"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Roseanne Barr has a lengthy list of controversies over her decades in the business. Though the scandals show no sign of stopping, after the cancellation of her Roseanne revival the comic has had little-to-no platform to let ‘er rip. One cannot have controversies without an audience, which, apart from her active YouTube Channel, Barr has lost almost entirely. Until now.

With the release of her Reelz documentary Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, she’s back, spewing her Trump rhetoric and blasting all the haters. The film, which wastes no time making a martyr of the actress, allows Barr to take one final stand against her cancellation. The likes of Mo’Nique, Howie Mandel and her Roseanne executive producer Allan Stephan all participate, offering kind words about their pal while she also defends herself.

For the most part, Barr spends her hour and a half attempting to reconcile her racist tweet aimed at White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “I shoulda not did it, but by God, I was really pissed that day,” Barr says. Returning to her original defense—the pills made her do it—she continues: “I did something I wouldn’t do if I hadn’t been on that Ambien. It makes you do a lot of crazy shit.”

Roseanne Barr: #MeToo Women are Hos, But Trump is a ‘Deep Thinker’

The original tweet, which resulted in the swift cancellation of the Roseanne reboot, read “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in a response to another tweet about Jarrett. In the doc, Barr and her closest allies unpack the night as it unfolded, starting with her attempting to “do the worst thing” she could do to piss off her producers.

Soon after, Barr received a phone call. Johnny Argent, the star’s longtime boyfriend, recalls hearing her shout, “Racist?! Iran isn’t a fucking race, you fucking idiot!”

Barr says that just 40 minutes after the tweet, her show was canceled. “I was called a racist,” she says in the doc, more upset with the world than herself. “It was politically expedient for them to shit on my name.”

Everyone interviewed in the doc continues to use the same excuse: Barr simply thought that Jarrett was white, and the Planet of the Apes comment was about anarchy in the Middle East. Sure. Still, her boyfriend pleads that “there’s not a racist bone in this woman’s body.”

After the tweet was unleashed, Barr attempted to clean up after herself by blaming Ambien, claiming that she didn’t know Jarrett’s race, and demanding to go on The View. But it was no use: Barr would be killed off of her own show, which was later spun into The Conners.

Roseanne Barr’s Daughter on Dealing With Mom’s Affair, Secret Daughter, and Racist Tweet

“Witch-burning is what it is,” Barr says. “Intellectual witch-burning, and arrogance and ignorance. All of the press of the United States and the world, how they interpreted my tweet without any knowledge of the fact that I was sending it to a journalist in Iran about what was happening to the people in Iran. We’re under such terrible censorship. It’s just terrible and frightening.”

As much as Barr would like to pin the dilemma on “witch-burning,” the fact is, her family and coworkers apparently attempted to yank the phone from her grip to get her to stop tweeting. While the comic spent every day of the 2016 election publicly expressing her loyalty to Donald Trump, the production team behind Roseanne would repeatedly tell her to take tweets down.

Roseanne Barr Regrets Apologizing to Valerie Jarrett, Argues Her Tweet Was ‘Not Racist’

“Everyone was begging me to give up my Twitter. Everyone,” Barr recalls. “My kids were trying to lock me out, but I wouldn’t! Because it’s like, I just couldn’t. I’m a goddamn American, I’m not going to do it. I’m a comic, I’m a bad girl, I’m too rock ’n’ roll. I’m going to say fuck it and fuck you ’til I take my last breath.”

Naturally, coming into the writers’ room guns a-blazin’, issues arose around every corner for the staff. Argent claims that the writers’ room “would not accept” Barr’s pro-Trump mentality, and others who worked on the production side claim that she was a “volatile character” and that “a lot of people had a difficult time with her.”

All in all, it definitely sounds like there were many factors leading up to the cancellation of Roseanne and the removal of Barr from her series. Diehard fans, however, shouldn’t worry:Yyou can still catch the comic whining about honey and interviewing staunch conservatives on her free YouTube channel.

"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

A dad-to-be was less than thrilled to learn that his wife was pregnant with their third daughter, provoking some strong opinions on the matter.

The footage, originally uploaded by the mom, @kc.fulton, gained over 42 million views on TikTok — but it gained even more traction when it was posted to Twitter by user @notcapnamerica.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a dad has gone viral for throwing a tantrum at a gender reveal party, but considering the backlash this footage has been receiving, it might be the last.

Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/ki3arQ2SgB — chris evans (@notcapnamerica) April 14, 2022

Twitter user @notcapnamerica gained over 10,000 replies when he posted the TikTok video with the caption, “Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this?”

In the video, we see the Fulton family gathered together for a gender reveal photo shoot. With her husband and two daughters by her side, @kc.fulton lifts an umbrella above her head and opens it — showering the family with a flurry of bright pink petals.

As the mom and daughters squeal with delight, Dad angrily shouts and curses, eventually walking out of frame altogether. Eventually, he crosses back into the video, only to cuss angrily again.

“I swear he’s happy,” the caption reads.

“It’s so ugly. I would never post the video,” one Twitter user wrote.

“He’s acting like a 2-year-old. I wouldn’t post this at all. I’d also stop having kids with him too. Babies are blessings. Period,” one user commented.

“I think the marriage would be over for me right at that moment,” another comment read.

“Same vibe with gender reveals when dad jumps up and down and gets excited because, finally, A BOY!!!” wrote another user.

“I hate this. Telling your daughter you don’t want her or [that] she already disappointed you before she was born. Don’t have kids if you are going to continue to burden them with impossible expectations,” replied one user.

“I hope the [baby] that’s coming never sees this. This is awful,” another comment read.

Since going viral, @kc.fulton has disabled comments on the controversial video. But in a follow-up video, she insists that her husband “loves ALL of his girls and they love him.”

“He has loved his babies since the second he found out we were having them! He IS a good dad,” the caption reads.

Let’s hope all three Fulton girls — and every daughter around the world — will be celebrated and loved all their lives.

These days, it seems you can barely go anywhere without hearing about the benefits of staying hydrated, especially as an athlete. And as much as I know that I need to drink a lot of water, staying on top of it just slips my mind. It’s not that I don’t drink any water, it’s just nowhere near a gallon of water a day—I usually drink one 25-ounce bottle and maybe a can of LaCroix.



That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

→ Get Bicycling All Access for the latest cycling and health tips!

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day. However, if you experience any negative side effects—like the ones associated with hyponatremia—slow down your rate of water consumption immediately, Lund advises.

"Coachella is a popular destination for influencers and Instagram fanatics. Callie Ahlgrim

Coachella in Indio, California, is one of the most famous music festivals.

Insider's music team found the reality was not exactly how it appeared on social media.

It's dusty, the food is expensive, and much of the day is spent sitting or weaving through crowds.

The first taste of the festival is not very picturesque.

Day parking at Coachella is free. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk from the parking lot is long, tedious, and extremely dusty.

Preferred parking costs $140 plus fees. Callie Ahlgrim

Festival workers try to reduce dust with water, but that often creates mud puddles.

It can take 20 to 30 minutes to reach the festival grounds from single-day parking lots. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk back is even worse.

Most headline performances end well past midnight. Callie Ahlgrim

Many people got lost trying to find their cars and were forced to cut through unmarked areas.

On the first day, there wasn't enough signage to help patrons find their way. Callie Ahlgrim

Some people took off their shoes because their feet had become so sore.

Cowboy boots were a popular footwear option at Coachella this year. Callie Ahlgrim

Lines at the festival are always long.

People who are over 21 receive a special wristband that must be renewed each day. Callie Ahlgrim

The line to buy merchandise is especially grueling.

Some people waited for more than two hours to buy merch. Callie Ahlgrim

You could wait 40 minutes or more to buy overpriced food.

There is classic fast food available, as well as vegan options. Callie Ahlgrim

This slice of cheese pizza cost $11.

It was OK. Callie Ahlgrim

This order of fries and onion rings cost $26.

The dipping sauces were free. Callie Ahlgrim

There are very few tables and seating areas, so people typically end up eating on the ground.

It's hard to find proper seating at Coachella if you don't have access to VIP areas. Callie Ahlgrim

In fact, people spend far more time sitting on the ground than you might expect.

People sat on the grass to watch Finneas perform. Callie Ahlgrim

The sun is so strong that people skip shows and activities just to sit in the shade.

There are art installations and structures that provide some relief from the sun. Callie Ahlgrim

It's so hot that some people can't bear to go near the stage, even if they want to watch the performance.

Coachella's Outdoor Theatre stage. Callie Ahlgrim

It can also be difficult to get close to the stage thanks to massive VIP sections, which are closed to regular patrons.

Coachella's Mojave stage. Callie Ahlgrim

Much of the day is spent weaving through crowds.

Coachella's Gobi stage. Callie Ahlgrim

Those crowds leave trash everywhere.

Throughout the day, workers can be seen picking up discarded bottles and food items. Callie Ahlgrim

The experience can be overwhelming and exhausting.

Some people just sleep on the ground. Callie Ahlgrim

"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

The indictment doesn’t mention the links to the Georgia government, information USA TODAY, the Savannah Morning News and the Augusta Chronicle pieced together from public records and a review of social media posts.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

Photo included in the Operation Blooming Onion ongoing criminal case as an exhibit. The partial address provided matches one reported as a guest farmworker housing location.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Roseanne Barr has a lengthy list of controversies over her decades in the business. Though the scandals show no sign of stopping, after the cancellation of her Roseanne revival the comic has had little-to-no platform to let ‘er rip. One cannot have controversies without an audience, which, apart from her active YouTube Channel, Barr has lost almost entirely. Until now.

With the release of her Reelz documentary Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, she’s back, spewing her Trump rhetoric and blasting all the haters. The film, which wastes no time making a martyr of the actress, allows Barr to take one final stand against her cancellation. The likes of Mo’Nique, Howie Mandel and her Roseanne executive producer Allan Stephan all participate, offering kind words about their pal while she also defends herself.

For the most part, Barr spends her hour and a half attempting to reconcile her racist tweet aimed at White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “I shoulda not did it, but by God, I was really pissed that day,” Barr says. Returning to her original defense—the pills made her do it—she continues: “I did something I wouldn’t do if I hadn’t been on that Ambien. It makes you do a lot of crazy shit.”

Roseanne Barr: #MeToo Women are Hos, But Trump is a ‘Deep Thinker’

The original tweet, which resulted in the swift cancellation of the Roseanne reboot, read “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in a response to another tweet about Jarrett. In the doc, Barr and her closest allies unpack the night as it unfolded, starting with her attempting to “do the worst thing” she could do to piss off her producers.

Soon after, Barr received a phone call. Johnny Argent, the star’s longtime boyfriend, recalls hearing her shout, “Racist?! Iran isn’t a fucking race, you fucking idiot!”

Barr says that just 40 minutes after the tweet, her show was canceled. “I was called a racist,” she says in the doc, more upset with the world than herself. “It was politically expedient for them to shit on my name.”

Story continues

Everyone interviewed in the doc continues to use the same excuse: Barr simply thought that Jarrett was white, and the Planet of the Apes comment was about anarchy in the Middle East. Sure. Still, her boyfriend pleads that “there’s not a racist bone in this woman’s body.”

After the tweet was unleashed, Barr attempted to clean up after herself by blaming Ambien, claiming that she didn’t know Jarrett’s race, and demanding to go on The View. But it was no use: Barr would be killed off of her own show, which was later spun into The Conners.

Roseanne Barr’s Daughter on Dealing With Mom’s Affair, Secret Daughter, and Racist Tweet

“Witch-burning is what it is,” Barr says. “Intellectual witch-burning, and arrogance and ignorance. All of the press of the United States and the world, how they interpreted my tweet without any knowledge of the fact that I was sending it to a journalist in Iran about what was happening to the people in Iran. We’re under such terrible censorship. It’s just terrible and frightening.”

As much as Barr would like to pin the dilemma on “witch-burning,” the fact is, her family and coworkers apparently attempted to yank the phone from her grip to get her to stop tweeting. While the comic spent every day of the 2016 election publicly expressing her loyalty to Donald Trump, the production team behind Roseanne would repeatedly tell her to take tweets down.

Roseanne Barr Regrets Apologizing to Valerie Jarrett, Argues Her Tweet Was ‘Not Racist’

“Everyone was begging me to give up my Twitter. Everyone,” Barr recalls. “My kids were trying to lock me out, but I wouldn’t! Because it’s like, I just couldn’t. I’m a goddamn American, I’m not going to do it. I’m a comic, I’m a bad girl, I’m too rock ’n’ roll. I’m going to say fuck it and fuck you ’til I take my last breath.”

Naturally, coming into the writers’ room guns a-blazin’, issues arose around every corner for the staff. Argent claims that the writers’ room “would not accept” Barr’s pro-Trump mentality, and others who worked on the production side claim that she was a “volatile character” and that “a lot of people had a difficult time with her.”

All in all, it definitely sounds like there were many factors leading up to the cancellation of Roseanne and the removal of Barr from her series. Diehard fans, however, shouldn’t worry:Yyou can still catch the comic whining about honey and interviewing staunch conservatives on her free YouTube channel.

Or, perhaps, check out Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, which will air on Reelz on April 24 at 8 p.m. ET.

"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

Story continues

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

A dad-to-be was less than thrilled to learn that his wife was pregnant with their third daughter, provoking some strong opinions on the matter.

The footage, originally uploaded by the mom, @kc.fulton, gained over 42 million views on TikTok — but it gained even more traction when it was posted to Twitter by user @notcapnamerica.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a dad has gone viral for throwing a tantrum at a gender reveal party, but considering the backlash this footage has been receiving, it might be the last.

Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track

Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/ki3arQ2SgB — chris evans (@notcapnamerica) April 14, 2022

Twitter user @notcapnamerica gained over 10,000 replies when he posted the TikTok video with the caption, “Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this?”

In the video, we see the Fulton family gathered together for a gender reveal photo shoot. With her husband and two daughters by her side, @kc.fulton lifts an umbrella above her head and opens it — showering the family with a flurry of bright pink petals.

As the mom and daughters squeal with delight, Dad angrily shouts and curses, eventually walking out of frame altogether. Eventually, he crosses back into the video, only to cuss angrily again.

“I swear he’s happy,” the caption reads.

“It’s so ugly. I would never post the video,” one Twitter user wrote.

“He’s acting like a 2-year-old. I wouldn’t post this at all. I’d also stop having kids with him too. Babies are blessings. Period,” one user commented.

“I think the marriage would be over for me right at that moment,” another comment read.

“Same vibe with gender reveals when dad jumps up and down and gets excited because, finally, A BOY!!!” wrote another user.

“I hate this. Telling your daughter you don’t want her or [that] she already disappointed you before she was born. Don’t have kids if you are going to continue to burden them with impossible expectations,” replied one user.

“I hope the [baby] that’s coming never sees this. This is awful,” another comment read.

Since going viral, @kc.fulton has disabled comments on the controversial video. But in a follow-up video, she insists that her husband “loves ALL of his girls and they love him.”

“He has loved his babies since the second he found out we were having them! He IS a good dad,” the caption reads.

Let’s hope all three Fulton girls — and every daughter around the world — will be celebrated and loved all their lives.

These days, it seems you can barely go anywhere without hearing about the benefits of staying hydrated, especially as an athlete. And as much as I know that I need to drink a lot of water, staying on top of it just slips my mind. It’s not that I don’t drink any water, it’s just nowhere near a gallon of water a day—I usually drink one 25-ounce bottle and maybe a can of LaCroix.



That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

→ Get Bicycling All Access for the latest cycling and health tips!

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day. However, if you experience any negative side effects—like the ones associated with hyponatremia—slow down your rate of water consumption immediately, Lund advises.

"Coachella is a popular destination for influencers and Instagram fanatics. Callie Ahlgrim

Coachella in Indio, California, is one of the most famous music festivals.

Insider's music team found the reality was not exactly how it appeared on social media.

It's dusty, the food is expensive, and much of the day is spent sitting or weaving through crowds.

The first taste of the festival is not very picturesque.

Day parking at Coachella is free. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk from the parking lot is long, tedious, and extremely dusty.

Preferred parking costs $140 plus fees. Callie Ahlgrim

Festival workers try to reduce dust with water, but that often creates mud puddles.

It can take 20 to 30 minutes to reach the festival grounds from single-day parking lots. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk back is even worse.

Most headline performances end well past midnight. Callie Ahlgrim

Many people got lost trying to find their cars and were forced to cut through unmarked areas.

On the first day, there wasn't enough signage to help patrons find their way. Callie Ahlgrim

Some people took off their shoes because their feet had become so sore.

Cowboy boots were a popular footwear option at Coachella this year. Callie Ahlgrim

Lines at the festival are always long.

People who are over 21 receive a special wristband that must be renewed each day. Callie Ahlgrim

The line to buy merchandise is especially grueling.

Some people waited for more than two hours to buy merch. Callie Ahlgrim

You could wait 40 minutes or more to buy overpriced food.

There is classic fast food available, as well as vegan options. Callie Ahlgrim

This slice of cheese pizza cost $11.

It was OK. Callie Ahlgrim

This order of fries and onion rings cost $26.

The dipping sauces were free. Callie Ahlgrim

There are very few tables and seating areas, so people typically end up eating on the ground.

It's hard to find proper seating at Coachella if you don't have access to VIP areas. Callie Ahlgrim

In fact, people spend far more time sitting on the ground than you might expect.

People sat on the grass to watch Finneas perform. Callie Ahlgrim

The sun is so strong that people skip shows and activities just to sit in the shade.

There are art installations and structures that provide some relief from the sun. Callie Ahlgrim

It's so hot that some people can't bear to go near the stage, even if they want to watch the performance.

It can also be difficult to get close to the stage thanks to massive VIP sections, which are closed to regular patrons.

Much of the day is spent weaving through crowds.

Those crowds leave trash everywhere.

Throughout the day, workers can be seen picking up discarded bottles and food items. Callie Ahlgrim

The experience can be overwhelming and exhausting.

Some people just sleep on the ground. Callie Ahlgrim

"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released their income tax returns last week. The first couple reported $610,702 in adjusted gross income and paid $150,439 in federal income tax at an effective tax rate of 24.6%.

While it’s unclear what former president Donald Trump’s income or tax bill was for 2021, we can compare Biden’s 2017 federal tax return with the data The New York Times reported on regarding Trump’s income tax payment in 2017.

Biden’s 2017 tax return showed $11,031,309 in adjusted gross income and a federal tax payment of $3,553,249. The New York Times reported that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes that year, the same as he paid in 2016.

According to The New York Times, the former president’s various businesses lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the previous 20 years, allowing him to reduce his federal tax obligation to almost nothing.

Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported by the Times. However, assumptions can be made based on Trump’s largest business venture - his real estate holdings.

Real Estate Tax Benefits

Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write off depreciation against income. In fact, it’s quite common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while actually receiving positive cash flow for the year.

This tax strategy can be seen across almost all equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, Piedmont Office Realty Trust (NYSE: PDM) reported a net loss of nearly $1.2 million for 2021, which included a $120.6 million expense for depreciation and amortization. The company’s actual funds from operations (FFO) was $245.4 million.

While the company’s tax returns showed a loss, it was actually able to pay out over $104 million to its shareholders for the year in dividends.

Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward. Companies, such as The Trump Organization, can carry losses over from one year to offset taxes in subsequent years. Trump used this strategy after realizing nearly $1 billion in losses in the early 90s. He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005.

Joe Biden’s 2017 income, on the other hand, was mainly earned through speaking engagements and book deals, neither of which offers the same tax advantages as real estate.

How Individuals Use This Tax Strategy

Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class. Investors can even take advantage of these tax benefits without having to purchase a skyscraper, hotel or apartment complex themselves.

Passive investments as a limited partner through private equity real estate deals can provide many of the same benefits. Investors that take part in a direct real estate investment through a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income, or loss, after deducting expenses like depreciation.

It’s not uncommon for investors to receive cash distributions throughout the year, then be able to show a loss on their tax returns.

It’s important to understand that each individual’s situation is different when it comes to income taxes and not all private equity real estate investments have the same pass-through tax structure. It’s always a good idea to consult with a certified public accountant to determine how a particular investment will affect your unique tax situation.

"How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stocks at a profit, you will owe taxes on those gains. Depending on how long you’ve owned the stock, you may owe at your regular income tax rate or at the capital gains rate, which is usually lower than the former. To pay taxes you owe on stock sales, use IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D. A financial advisor who serves your area can help you with tax planning for your investments and retirement.

The Basics on How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stock for less you bought it for, you won’t owe any income tax on the losses. In fact, you may be able to use this loss to reduce your taxes. If you sell stock for more than you paid, however, you’ll have a profit and may need to pay taxes on that gain.

If you’ve owned the stock for less than a year before selling it at a profit, you’ll owe taxes on it at your regular income tax rate. If you owned the stocks for more than a year, the long-term capital gains tax rates apply. These rates are dependent on your overall income, but may be 0%, 15% or 20%.

You can use SmartAsset’s capital gains calculator to estimate the taxes you’ll owe. The calculator can also figure the estimated capital gains taxes on profits from sales of other assets, such as real estate, collectibles and cryptocurrency.

A basic strategy for reducing taxes on stock sale profits is to hold stocks that have appreciated since purchase for at least a year before selling them. This ensures profits on stock sales will be taxed at the usually lower capital gains rate. Another approach is to sell stocks that have declined in value in order to generate a loss that can be used to shelter gains.

Note that whether you owe income taxes at your regular rate or the capital gains rate, you don’t owe Social Security or Medicare taxes on gain from sales of stocks. Investment income, including profits from stock sales as well as dividends and interest, is considered passive income and does not pay these taxes. However, passive income is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

Using IRS Form 8949 to Pay Taxes on Your Stocks

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Whether you show a profit or a loss, you’ll report stock sales on IRS Form 8949. This is the tax form used for reporting sales or exchanges of any capital assets not reported elsewhere. The information about stock sales needed on your Form 8949 should come from a Form 1099-B issued by the brokerage you are using. This will identify the stock, the dates it was acquired and sold, the sale price and cost of the stock, the profit or loss and any federal or state income taxes that were withheld. The IRS and state taxing authorities will also get a copy of the 1099-B. If you don’t get a 1099-B from your brokerage for some reason, use your own records to fill out Form 8949.

Form 8949 has two parts. The first is for short-term transactions on assets held less than a year. To fill out each part, on the first line enter the information for each stock you sold under the appropriate column. You’ll provide the stock name and number of shares, purchase and sale dates, sale price, cost and profit or loss.

You won’t usually need to enter anything in the columns for adjustments. See the instructions for Form 8949 for details. At the bottom of the form total the amounts in the columns for sale price, cost and profit or loss.

On the second part of the form, enter the same information for sales of assets held for more than a year.

Filling Out Schedule D

Schedule D is one of the schedules that are part of Form 1040. After filling out Form 8949, taxpayers transfer the totals to Schedule D. From this they can generate the overall gain or loss from stock transactions.

Like Form 8949, Schedule D also separates transactions into long- and short-term gains. The difference is still based on whether the asset was owned for a year or less.

The totals from Schedule D get transferred to the taxpayer’s 1040 on line 7. Also, any tax that the brokerage withheld when the stock was sold will be reported on Form 1040. You can learn more from the IRS instructions for Schedule D.

Bottom Line

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Investors who buy and sell stocks will reports the gains and losses to the IRS on Form 1040 using Form 8949 and Schedule D. These forms separate stock sale profits into long- and short-term capital gains. The difference between them is that long-term gains are taxed at the potentially lower capital gains rate, while investors pay taxes on short-term gains at their regular tax rates, which are usually higher.

Tax Planning Tips

Crafting a tax-efficient strategy to make the most of your investment gains can benefit from the assistance of a financial advisor. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

"Not even inflation can diminish the dominance of Tiger Woods.

The latest reminder came at Hilton Head when Jordan Spieth overcame an 18-inch miss on Saturday and a three-shot deficit on Sunday to beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his 13th career PGA Tour victory.

Along with a tartan jacket (he looks better in green) and a spot in the winners-only field at Kapalua next January (a big perk to him), Spieth earned $1,440,000. That made him the 11th player in PGA Tour history to cross the $50 million mark in career earnings.

Officially, he is the youngest player at 28 years and 9 months to reach $50 million.

That's where inflation comes in.

Woods is the only other player to reach $50 million in career tour earnings before turning 30. He was 29 and 6 months when he was runner-up at the Western Open in 2005, pushing him over a milestone that he quickly left in the rearview mirror.

Woods needed only seven more years to cross $100 million, and now he is at $120,895,206.

Spieth was among a half-dozen players who inconspicuously leaned over the railing from the second floor of PGA Tour headquarters last month to watch as Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He would be quick to acknowledge that a number like $50 million wouldn't even exist without Woods.

Yes, there was a significant difference in purses.

Total prize money when Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996 was $65.95 million. Spieth turned pro in 2013 — like Woods, without a tour card — and the total prize fund was $260 million.

While both reached $50 million in roughly nine years, Woods did it in 41 fewer tournaments (177 compared with 218 for Spieth). The average total prize money for Woods during that stretch was $173.8 million. For Spieth, it was $322.56 million.

Rory McIlroy is a better comparison. He turned pro nearly six years before Spieth and has kept a global schedule with membership on two tours. McIlroy needed only 173 events on the PGA Tour to reach $50 million at Bay Hill in 2020, about six weeks before he turned 31.

Story continues

Scores are coming down and prize money is going up. Such is the evolution of sport. The best measure will always be victories.

Woods has 82 on the PGA Tour alone — 11 more on tours in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe — and 15 majors. Those are the numbers that define him. When he passed $50 million, Woods already had 43 tour victories.

Money still matters, though not entirely to Woods. He was asked at Riviera a few months ago if he knew how much was in his deferred compensation package.

“Nope. Uh-uh,” he said.

Does he want to know?

“Uh-uh,” he said.

Still, this can be added to his long list of feats that might never be matched, right up there with 142 consecutive cuts and needing only seven starts to qualify for the Tour Championship.

Woods has been atop the PGA Tour career money list for 22 years.

It used to be a contest. Greg Norman took the lead over Tom Kite in August 1995 by winning the World Series of Golf at Firestone, and he kept it until the last week in January 2000 when Davis Love III moved past him after the Phoenix Open.

Love stayed on top all of two weeks until Woods was runner-up at Torrey Pines and took over. It took 73 tournaments from his “Hello, world” introduction to Woods leading the career money list, and the gap has only widened.

Spieth is not ready to declare himself all the way back — “close but far” is what he said after he won the RBC Heritage. He has two wins in just over a year, but also seven finishes out of the top 25 since winning the Texas Open last year and three missed cuts this year.

He will always be compared with how he started his career.

It was at the Valspar Championship in 2015 when Spieth, then 21 and in his third year, played a practice round with three others born the same year — Justin Thomas, Daniel Berger and Ollie Schniederjans. They lined up for a group photo from oldest to youngest, sharing birthdates to make sure they got it right. Spieth was the youngest.

This was one week after he passed $9 million in career money.

Spieth went on to win five times that year, including the Masters and U.S. Open, missing the British Open playoff by one shot and finishing second in the PGA Championship. He had a 60% rate finishing in the top 10 and set a PGA Tour record with $12,030,465 in earnings.

Woods in 2000 won nine times, including three majors. He was runner-up four times and only finished out of the top 10 three times in 20 starts. He made $9,188,321 that year.

The money keeps going up. The Players Championship paid $3.6 million to the winner — the total purse was $3.5 million the first year Woods played.

Is it enough for anyone to catch Woods?

McIlroy, who turns 33 in two weeks, is just over $59 million behind. Spieth is $70 million back, and not quite $4 million ahead of his contemporary, Justin Thomas. Dustin Johnson has just over $74 million in career earnings. He turns 38 in June.

Even with today's money, they all seem so far away. Just like always.

"John Daly II has played exactly one tournament for the University of Arkansas and posted just a single round under par during that event, but that didn’t stop the freshman from signing a name, image, likeness deal with Hooters, an agreement that was announced on Tuesday.

The son of two-time major champ John Daly played in one tournament last fall for the Razorbacks, posting scores of 83-68-78 at the Blessings Collegiate Invitational in October.

The Dalys combined in December to win the PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, using a 36-hole total of 27-under 117 to beat Tiger and Charlie Woods. In the process, the tandem broke the previous tournament scoring record set by Davis Love III/Dru Love in 2018 by one stroke, and earned Team Daly the red-leather Willie Park winner’s belts.

The Dalys will promote the world-famous @Hooters brand through various marketing activities, including significant roles on social media and other digital channels. pic.twitter.com/gN2SKOP0KX — Kristi Dosh (@SportsBizMiss) April 19, 2022

Also, the younger Daly placed T-12 in the 2022 New Year’s Invitational at St. Petersburg Country Club, posting rounds of 69 and 68 in the process. That event was won by Remi Chartier of East Tennessee State. The freshman from Clearwater has seen little time in the Arkansas lineup as stars Mateo Fernández de Oliveira and Luke Long have led the way. The Razorbacks won the SEC Match Play Championship in the fall at Shoal Creek, and currently sit at No. 11 in the Golfweek/Sagarin collegiate team rankings.

The senior Daly said via Twitter that he was happy to continue the family relationship with the brand.

Story continues

“Can’t express how excited I am to be back with my @Hooters family & having my son beside me on the next generation!” he said.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Hooters is thrilled to make our long-standing relationship with John official and to enter an exciting new venture with Little John as our first NIL ambassador,” Bruce Skala, Hooters senior VP of marketing, said in a release. “John’s larger-than-life personality makes him an ideal representative of Hooters’ fun-loving spirit, while Little John will promote our brand to the next generation as one of the next big names in golf. We are ecstatic to have the Dalys, fantastic golfers and great personalities, on board as spokespeople for Hooters, the definitive 19th hole.”

NIL deals continue to make news as the stakes for college athletes is raised. For example, a five-star high school recruit in the 2023 class recently signed a name, image and likeness collective with a school that could earn him $8 million before his senior year at the college, The Athletic reported.

Since the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision in June 2021 that threw out the NCAA’s restrictions on “education-related benefits,” almost 30 states have passed legislation about NIL and its governance, despite being no federal law to oversee it.

The NCAA is expected to file a report to discuss how NIL is impacting college athletics, despite the Supreme Court ruling that “the NCAA is not above the law” in its unanimous decision.

"There were plenty of familiar faces kick-starting the festivities over the weekend in the season-opening week of the USFL. One of those faces was former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kyle Sloter.

As the leading signal caller for the New Orleans Breakers, Sloter stepped under center on Sunday and helped lead the team to a 23-17 win over the Philadelphia Stars.

Granted, the team was carried by the defense for the most part with linebacker Vontae Diggs snatching a pick-six early in the ballgame. The team also leaned heavily on the legs of running back Jordan Ellis, along with the versatile playmaking abilities of T.J. Logan Jr.

Sloter, who was actually signed to the Vikings’ active roster last December, went 17-of-27 passing for 150 yards and one interception. So it wasn’t necessarily the big coming-out-party he hoped it would be. But the outcome played out in his favor, and he can look forward to improving in his next outing.

The 28-year-old quarterback played for six different teams during his time in the NFL, including two pit stops in Minnesota.

At the very least, it’s a positive turn of events seeing a former journeyman get some well-deserved shine as a starter in a new league.

"DALLAS (AP) — Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber and the Dallas Mavericks got even in their first-round playoff series with a bunch of a 3-pointers, their fewest turnovers ever in a postseason game, and without injured superstar Luka Doncic.

Brunson scored a career-high 41 points, Maxi Kleber had 25 with eight of their playoff-record 22 made 3-pointers and the Mavericks, with only three turnovers, beat the Utah Jazz 110-104 in Game 2 on Monday night.

In danger of dropping the first two games after opening the playoffs with home-court advantage for the first time since their NBA title 11 years ago, the Mavericks even overcame a 10-point deficit after halftime.

Kleber, who had made only 19% of his 3-point attempts since the All-Star break, was 8-of-11 from beyond the arc and put the Mavs ahead to stay with 4:21 left, then added another 3 on the next possession.

“I started this morning, I was talking to (Dorian Finney-Smith) and I told him, ‘Doe, I’m going to let 10 3s fly tonight.’ And he said, ‘That’s my dog.’ And that kind of set the tone for the day,” Kleber said. “The mindset is we know they’re going to leave certain guys open to shoot. We’ve just got to let it fly.”

Game 3 is Thursday night in Utah, where Dallas has lost its last 11 games.

“We did what we had to do, which was win tonight. But we were only focused on tonight,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “We understand what’s in front of us, what’s coming. It’s going to be a hostile environment.”

Brunson, the starting point guard with Doncic out, became the fifth Dallas player to score 40 points in a playoff game. He is the first Mavericks player to do that without committing a turnover. The other 40-point scorers were Doncic, Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman and Nick Van Exel.

Donovan Mitchell had 34 points for Utah, while Bojan Bogdanovic had 25 and Jordan Clarkson 21. Rudy Gobert had eight points and 17 rebounds.

“We tried to go out there and take both (games). Didn’t happen. You know we’re not going to overreact. We’re going to go home, and we’ve got to take care of business. Simple as that,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we’re happy we took a game and go back and take care of business.”

Story continues

Dallas had led only once in the second half until a 10-0 run capped by a go-ahead 3 by Finney-Smith and a jumper by Brunson. Royce O'Neale then hit a tying 3-pointer and Mitchell made a short jumper to put Utah back in front before Kleber's back-to-back 3s.

""The telltale is we can’t have Brunson have the night he had and also be able to kick the ball out for those looks,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “And when those passes are kicked out, I thought we weren’t as sharp mentally in our ability to rotate. And that’s something that we’ve done before.”

Doncic was still out because of a strained left calf he suffered in the regular season finale eight days earlier. Kidd said before the game that the 23-year-old All-Star was making progress, “definitely going in the right direction” and doing more each day.

Brunson, who had 24 points when the Mavs lost 99-93 in Game 1, made his first five shots — with three 3s — in the first 6 minutes.

“I’m just playing how the defense is giving me, just seeing how they’re defending certain things. Just stepping into certain shots,” Brunson said. “Yeah, the 5-of-5 start is great, but I had the same mentality when I was 0 for 5 last game, or whatever. ... You can’t fluctuate whenever, not even when (Doncic) is in or out. Because you need guys to make plays.”

TIP-INS

Jazz: Utah wiped out a five-point deficit in the final minute of of the first quarter to tie the game at 24. The sequence started with Gobert’s putback dunk. The 7-foot-1 center, the NBA’s top defensive player three of the previous four seasons who finished third for this season’s award announced earlier Monday, then had a block before a 3 from Clarkson, who initially was tripped up moving through the lane before getting up and getting the ball back in the corner.

Mavericks: The Mavs finished 21 of 41 on 3s (51.2%) and shot 50% overall (36 of 72). ... Spencer Dinwiddie had all three Dallas turnovers, two on plays that could have easily been fouls against Utah. He had 17 points and six assists. ... Dallas led the NBA during the regular season with 17 wins after coming back from deficits of at least 10 points.

SAME DRAFT

Brunson, whose previous high was 34 points during his rookie season, is in the final year of his rookie deal and is unsigned past this season. The former NCAA championship guard at Villanova was drafted in 2018, the same year as Doncic.

“He’s going to make a lot of money. I don’t know if he needs an agent, but I’ll put my name in the hat,” Kidd said, apparently not aware that Brunson has the same agent as Doncic. ""It’s not just what he did tonight. It’s not what he’s going to do going forward. He’s already done the work. He’s showing that he deserves to be paid. He does his job at a very high level, and he’s a winner.

"Tuesday, April 19, brings a robust 10-game main slate with a first pitch time of 7:10 p.m. ET on Yahoo, DraftKings and FanDuel. Let’s get into the top MLB DFS picks for pitchers and stacks for Yahoo, DraftKings and FanDuel daily fantasy baseball lineups. As always, you can head over to the Awesemo MLB DFS & Fantasy Baseball home page for all the fantasy baseball content you need for any given slate.

MLB DFS Picks Today: Spotlight Pitchers and Top Stacks | Tuesday, April 19

Yahoo Stack of the Day: Boston Red Sox vs. LHP Yusei Kikuchi — 5.0 implied runs

Yesterday the Red Sox lost the early-morning Patriot’s Day game, but they should bounce back tonight in a tasty matchup against lefty Yusei Kikuchi. The former Mariner can be exploited by right-handed hitting, which is something that Boston brings to this matchup. Trevor Story ($15) and Bobby Dalbec ($9) are steals on Yahoo tonight, along with J.D. Martinez ($18), Xander Bogaerts ($17) and Enrique “Kike” Hernandez ($17). This will be a popular stack, though there are plenty of other ways to find roster differentiation with a 20-team player pool.

Late Slate: Oakland Athletics vs. Baltimore Orioles — 4.3 implied runs

The Orioles have not yet announced a starter for tonight, so we could be looking at a bullpen game — or a minor league callup. Either way, the longer the uncertainty lasts, the longer the Athletics will stay under the radar. Somehow, Oakland is tied for the league lead with 58 runs scored, putting it in the same lofty tier as the Dodgers. There will be regression at some point, as half of the A’s lineup consists of replacement-level players, but until that happens, we need to follow the infamous words of Crash Davis and “Respect the streak.” Sean Murphy and Seth Brown are the above-average options, and then players such as Billy McKinney, Elvis Andrus and Tony Kemp can be feathered in for differentiation. There is no need to go overboard with four- or five-man stacks, but using duos and trios from the Athletics does provide some discounted upside potential on all slates.

Spotlight Pitchers

Top MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Corbin Burnes vs. Pittsburgh Pirates — 2.9 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $58 | FanDuel $10,800 | DraftKings $10,500

Yahoo has broken its soft pitching salary cap of $55 for the reigning National League Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes. The matchup against a watered-down Pirates squad is one of the best any pitcher will get this season. There will be enough discount dandies finding their way into lineups tonight that employing Burnes as an ace should not be an issue. Through two starts, Burnes has logged a dozen innings with as many strikeouts, allowing just three earned runs. Over the last two seasons, the projected Pittsburgh lineup has been dreadful against right-handed hurlers, with a 0.272 wOBA, 0.068 ISO and a 6.0% walk rate. Enjoy!

Secondary MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Joe Musgrove vs. Cincinnati Reds — 3.2 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $50 | FanDuel $11,000 | DraftKings $8,600

The DraftKings salary algorithm is giving a nice discount for Joe Musgrove in a matchup against a patchwork Cincinnati squad. FanDuel went a little overboard, though; with its loose salaries, it is not too difficult to roster Musgrove. The Reds are without Nick Castellanos, Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez, who are all playing for new teams. Mike Moustakas is day-to-day with an arm injury, and Tyler Naquin was placed on the injured list Monday. That means Joey Votto will be the lone above-average lefty in the lineup with Jake Fraley and Colin Moran likely joining him, along with their elevated strikeout rates. In his last 117 same-handed matchups, Aristides Aquino has struck out 48.7% of the time. While Tommy Pham rolled up a three-hit game against his former squad last night, including a double and a home run, his best days are well behind him. Things are looking good for Musgrove tonight, and he should be rostered with confidence.

Wild Card MLB DFS Picks Target: LHP Cole Irvin vs. Baltimore Orioles — 3.7 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $29 | FanDuel $7,100 | DraftKings $6,300

Today’s wild card is lefty Cole Irvin, who has both an appealing matchup and salary on Yahoo and DraftKings, where two pitchers are required for each lineup. Baltimore does project to put in nearly a full complement of right-handed hitters against Irving tonight, and while it do have above-average power (.207 ISO) that comes with a lot of strikeout (25.7%) upside. While Irvin has below-average strikeout stuff, he has solid control allowing very few walks and extra-base hits. When looking to a low-upside pitcher like Irvin, it is important to also account for how the salary relief he provides can be employed across the remainder of the lineup.

Final MLB DFS Thoughts & Weather Notes for the Tuesday, April 19 Fantasy Baseball Slate

Tuesday brings a brief respite from the precipitation we saw on Monday. Most outdoor venues in the Midwest and East Coast are still experiencing cold and likely will for the next two or three weeks. The White Sox at Guardians game in Cleveland was postponed, though with the 6:10 p.m. ET start time it was not represented on many Tuesday slates.

Welcome to the NBC Sports EDGE MLB Power Rankings, a weekly feature that will run every Tuesday through the end of the 2022 regular season. These rankings are not fantasy-driven in any way, though I do tend to sprinkle in fantasy-relevant nuggets here and there. Who’s hot, who’s not, who to watch -- that sort of thing. Send any and all complaints to me on Twitter: @drewsilv.

Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.

1. Los Angeles Dodgers

Record: 8-2

Last Week: 3

It’s quite fitting that Freddie Freeman connected for his first Dodgers home run in his first at-bat of the night Monday against the visiting Braves. The solo shot to left-center put Los Angeles up 1-0 in the bottom of the first, and Freeman also scored a run following a walk in the bottom of the fourth. All part of a 7-4 victory, the Dodgers’ seventh straight victory since they lost two games at Colorado’s Coors Field over opening weekend. This team is stacked with talent and now fully hitting its stride.

2. Toronto Blue Jays

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 1

There’s no shame in being leapfrogged by the streaking Dodgers. Toronto has yet to lose a series this season, having taken two of three from the Rangers to open things up, then splitting a four-game set at Yankee Stadium, before grabbing another two of three against the A’s over the weekend. Teoscar Hernandez will be sorely missed as he recovers from a left oblique strain. The 29-year-old has batted .295/.347/.538 with 49 homers and 153 RBI in 199 games since the beginning of 2020.

3. New York Mets

Record: 7-3

Last Week: 4

Tylor Megill will take the bump in the first half of Tuesday’s doubleheader versus the Giants following a rainout in Queens on Monday. Essentially the fill-in for Jacob deGrom, Megill has looked very deGrom-like in the early going with a 0.00 ERA, 0.58 WHIP, and 11/0 K/BB ratio in two starts covering 10 1/3 innings. Francisco Lindor is well on his way to a big-time fantasy bounceback, boasting a 1.048 OPS with three homers, seven RBI, two steals, and nine runs scored in 10 games.

Story continues

4. Chicago White Sox

Record: 6-3

Last Week: 5

Already looking like a runaway favorite in the AL Central, the White Sox have won all three of their series so far against the Tigers, Mariners, and Rays. Dylan Cease, the defacto ace with Lance Lynn (knee) and Lucas Giolito (abdomen) on the shelf, is 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA and 16 strikeouts over 10 2/3 innings. Tim Anderson has batted .393 with a 1.021 OPS through 29 plate appearances since missing the first two games of the year due to a suspension stemming from a late-2021 dustup.

5. Atlanta Braves

Record: 5-7

Last Week: 2

A little bit of panic for the reigning World Series champions, who began the year as the No. 1 team in these rankings and are now barely clinging to a top-five spot. The bottom-third of the lineup is badly struggling, most notably Dansby Swanson. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts in Monday night’s loss to the Dodgers and is 6-for-42 (.141) with 20 whiffs through 12 games to begin the year. The good news is that Ronald Acuña (knee) appears set to begin a rehab assignment on Tuesday.

6. Houston Astros

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 6

Yordan Alvarez returned Monday from a week-long absence due to illness and sure looked to be back at peak health, going 3-for-5 with a pair of 420-foot home runs and a fourth-inning single that came off his bat 109.6 mph. His four-RBI night helped the Astros to a decisive 8-3 win over the division-rival Angels. The 24-year-old masher is sporting a 1.153 OPS through his first 22 plate appearances this season. For his career, he’s averaging 42 homers and 129 RBI in every 162 games played.

7. Milwaukee Brewers

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 7

Christian Yelich hit his first home run of the year, a fourth-inning grand slam, as the Brewers cruised to a 6-1 victory against the Pirates on Monday in Milwaukee. Including his results from the Cactus League this spring, it was the first time that Yelich had gone deep since September 24, 2021. Eric Lauer got the start on Monday, working six innings of one-run ball, and now Pittsburgh will have to contend with Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff in the final two games of the three-game set.

8. New York Yankees

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 9

It came in a late 5-0 loss to the Orioles, but Nestor Cortes struck out 12 batters over five scoreless innings on Sunday, becoming the first pitcher in Yankees franchise history to record 12-plus strikeouts in five frames or fewer. Including his strong season debut on April 12 against a dangerous Blue Jays team, the 27-year-old left-hander holds a 0.00 ERA and 17/1 K/BB ratio in 9 1/3 innings to begin the 2022 campaign. He’s lined up for a showdown versus the visiting Guardians this Saturday.

9. Tampa Bay Rays

Record: 5-6

Last Week: 8

Wander Franco was scratched from the Rays’ lineup on Monday at Wrigley Field, though manager Kevin Cash did tell reporters after the game -- a 4-2 loss for Tampa Bay -- that his star shortstop could be ready to return as early as Tuesday. Injuries have already wreaked havoc on the pitching side of the depth chart, with Shane Baz, Luis Patino, Tyler Glasnow, Yonny Chirinos, Brendan McKay, Nick Anderson, and Pete Fairbanks currently on the 60-day IL. Ryan Yarbrough is on the 10-day IL.

10. San Francisco Giants

Record: 7-2

Last Week: 14

The reigning NL West champs are on a five-game winning streak after their weekend sweep at Cleveland. San Francisco’s pitching staff currently holds the lowest combined ERA in the majors at 2.20. And has Brandon Belt’s late-career surge drawn enough praise? The veteran first baseman struck a two-run homer in Sunday’s rout of the Guardians and carries a .996 OPS (169 OPS+) with 41 home runs and 96 RBI in 155 games since the beginning of the delayed and condensed 2020 season.

11. San Diego Padres

Record: 7-5

Last Week: 12

Sean Manaea tossed six innings of one-run ball and Manny Machado slugged his second home run of the year as the Padres sailed to a 4-1 win over the visiting Reds on Monday night at Petco Park. Taylor Rogers, an Opening Day addition from the Twins, closed that one out for his NL-leading fifth save. And here’s a fun note: San Diego is the first team in MLB history to go 12 games without an error to begin a season. Sharp all-around play has put the Friars in solid position here in mid-April.

12. Philadelphia Phillies

Record: 4-7

Last Week: 10

Philly has lost six of its last seven games versus the Mets, Marlins, and Rockies. And there is heightened concern around Bryce Harper, who is currently limited to DH duties because of tendinitis in his right (throwing) elbow. “Get treatment on it and try to get through it,” the 29-year-old outfielder said of the ailment on Monday. “I’ve never had arm problems in my life, so this is very new to me. Just trying to feel it out and see what happens.” That certainly seems like something to monitor.

13. Boston Red Sox

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 11

Patriots’ Day is supposed to be a celebratory event in New England. The improving weather, the Boston Marathon, the early start time at Fenway Park. But the 2022 edition of that regional holiday will not be remembered so fondly after the Red Sox fell 8-3 to the visiting Twins. Rich Hill got the start on Monday and gave up four earned runs over 4 2/3 innings while watching his early-season ERA rise to 7.00. He’s looking every bit of 42 years old for a team that needs reliable pitching production.

14. St. Louis Cardinals

Record: 5-3

Last Week: 15

After taking three of four from the Pirates and Royals to open the season, the Cardinals then split a four-game weekend series with the reigning NL Central-champion Brewers. Albert Pujols ripped his second home run of the year, and the 681st home run of his career, in Sunday’s loss at American Family Field. It left his bat at 109.9 mph and traveled 426 feet. He’s now just 19 big flies away from joining Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, and Babe Ruth as the fourth member of the 700 home run club.

15. Seattle Mariners

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 13

They won two of three versus the division-rival Astros over the weekend, but the Mariners are .500 through 10 games. It’s not the most ideal start for an organization that is aiming to end a 20-year postseason drought, the longest such drought in North American sports. Julio Rodriguez is 4-for-32 (.125) with only one extra-base hit through his first nine major league games. And while Jarred Kelenic did homer last week against the White Sox, his batting line currently sits at .172/.242/.310.

16. Los Angeles Angels

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 16

Anaheim had won five of its last six games before falling 8-3 to the reigning AL West-champion Astros on Monday night in Houston. Mike Trout was missing from action in that one after taking a pitch off the top of his left hand on Sunday afternoon in Arlington. The good news is that X-rays and an MRI both came back negative for any structural damage. Word from Angels head athletic trainer Mike Frostad is that Trout will have to determine his own readiness for a return based on pain tolerance.

17. Minnesota Twins

Record: 4-6

Last Week: 17

Byron Buxton sadly -- predictably? -- tweaked something in his right knee while sliding into second base last Friday against the Red Sox. But the star outfielder has yet to be placed on the injured list, and Twins manager Rocco Baldelli expressed optimism on Monday that Buxton would be able to return to action sometime later this week. The same can’t be said for Alex Kirilloff, who landed on the IL last Wednesday due to a recurrence of wrist discomfort that dates all the way back to 2019.

18. Detroit Tigers

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 18

The growing expectations for the Tigers may have to be put on hold, as they were forced to place Javier Baez on the injured list over the weekend due to lingering soreness in his right thumb and will be without former No. 1 overall pick Casey Mize for an extended period after he was diagnosed with a medial collateral ligament sprain in his right elbow. There’s also some concern about Matt Manning, who left his start Sunday afternoon against the Royals because of shoulder discomfort.

19. Cleveland Guardians

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 19

Jose Ramirez was named American League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, claiming the honor for the fifth time in his illustrious 10-year major league career. The star third baseman agreed to a five-year, $124 million contract extension with Cleveland a just few days before Opening Day and has been red-hot out of the gate here in 2022, boasting a .457/.500/.886 batting line with eight extra-base hits (three homers, four doubles, one triple) and 15 RBI through nine games played.

20. Chicago Cubs

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 21

Seiya Suzuki was named National League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, becoming only the eighth Japanese-born player to earn that honor. He then went 2-for-3 with two runs scored in the Cubs’ 4-2 defeat of the Rays on Monday night at Wrigley Field, growing his overall batting line to .429/.564/.929 through 39 plate appearances. He is the first Cubs player to hit safely in his first 10 major league games since Andy Pafko in 1943. We’ll say it: Suzuki is your 2021 NL Rookie of the Year.

21. Colorado Rockies

Record: 7-3

Last Week: 25

A relatively sparking 7-3 record through 10 games for the Rockies. They took two of three from the Dodgers to begin the season, swept a two-game set from the Rangers, split four with the Cubs over the weekend, and then shut down the Phillies for a 4-1 win on Monday night at Coors Field. C.J. Cron has a 1.129 OPS with five home runs and 10 RBI through 43 plate appearances. Connor Joe, who has seemingly taken over the leadoff role, is currently slashing .359/.468/.641.

22. Kansas City Royals

Record: 3-5

Last Week: 20

Major League Baseball is hard. Just ask Bobby Witt Jr., who was widely regarded as the No. 1 overall prospect in the sport after batting .290/.361/.576 with 33 homers and 29 steals over 124 games last summer in the minors. Witt tore up the Cactus League this spring and claimed a spot on the Opening Day roster in Kansas City, but he’s showing a weak .156/.182/.281 slash line through his first 33 plate appearances at the MLB level. He has struck out 11 times while drawing only one walk.

23. Miami Marlins

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 23

After winning only one of five games against the Giants and Angels to begin the 2022 campaign, the Marlins rallied to take three of four from the division-rival Phillies over the weekend. In a lopsided 11-3 victory on Sunday afternoon, Jazz Chisholm tallied an RBI triple in the bottom of the second, an RBI double in the bottom of the sixth, and a run-scoring sac fly in the bottom of the seventh. The dynamic 24-year-old has already driven home 10 runs in just seven games played.

24. Oakland Athletics

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 28

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 news cycle has yet to fully let up. Oakland got hit hard on Monday, having to place Austin Allen, Jed Lowrie, Chad Pinder, A.J. Puk, Kirby Snead, and Lou Trivino on the IL due to either positive tests, contact tracing, COVID-like symptoms, or some variety of the three. And yet the Athletics went out and earned a 5-1 win in their home opener against the Orioles and are a game above the .500 mark as the second full week of the 2022 season gets underway.

25. Arizona Diamondbacks

Record: 3-6

Last Week: 26

As a group right now, the Diamondbacks have a combined .152/.284/.264 slash line through 330 plate appearances. Seth Beer is the only Arizona hitter with a batting average above .212 and an OPS north of .704. Pull out Beer’s contributions and the collective line for the D-backs falls to .133/.272/.239 in 307 plate appearances. The rotation and its 3.03 ERA has been severely mistreated. They’re only moving up a spot in this week’s rankings because the Rangers so richly deserved to drop.

26. Texas Rangers

Record: 2-7

Last Week: 22

Not that the offense has been humming -- Marcus Semien is off to an especially discouraging start -- but it’s the pitching staff that is going to hold this team back from any semblance of contention after that big wintertime spending spree. As of Tuesday afternoon, Rangers starters and relievers have combined for a 6.19 ERA, by far the worst mark of any MLB team. Jon Gray (blister) is set to return from the injured list Tuesday at Seattle, but he’s doubtful to be the hero that Texas badly needs.

27. Washington Nationals

Record: 4-7

Last Week: 27

This is shaping up to be a very rough season for the Nationals, who just dropped three of four to the lowly Pirates. But, hey, they do still have Juan Soto. The 23-year-old slugger had a solo home run, a double, and two walks on Saturday in Pittsburgh and has now reached base at least four times in 54 different games over the course of his young career. The most games reaching base safely four-plus times before age 24 … Ted Williams: 76, Buddy Lewis: 55, Juan Soto: 54, Mel Ott: 53.

28. Cincinnati Reds

Record: 2-9

Last Week: 24

After getting dismantled by the Dodgers over the weekend in Los Angeles and falling 4-1 to the Padres on Monday night in San Diego, the Reds sit at the very bottom of the team OPS leaderboard with a mark of just .541. It doesn’t help that 2021 NL Rookie of the Year Award winner Jonathan India hasn’t played since last Thursday -- and apparently won’t be ready to return before this Friday -- because of a right hamstring issue. Hunter Greene is fun; Cincinnati’s offense currently is not.

29. Pittsburgh Pirates

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 29

Diego Castillo provided the only run of the night for the Pirates in their loss Monday against the Brewers, belting an opposite-field solo shot in the top of the fourth inning. The 24-year-old infielder also stroked a single in the top of the sixth and has raced out to a .310 batting average across his first 29 plate appearances as a big leaguer. Castillo has been handling second base for the Bucs with Ke’Bryan Hayes locked in long term at third. Now let’s bring on top shortstop prospect Oneil Cruz.

30. Baltimore Orioles

Record: 3-7

Last Week: 30

O’s fans -- and fantasy managers -- are mostly awaiting the arrival of Adley Rutschman, who could have maybe cracked the Opening Day roster in Baltimore had he not suffered a strained right triceps muscle at the very start of camp this spring. There is good news on that front, though, as general manager Mike Elias said on the MASN broadcast over the weekend that the 24-year-old top prospect should begin catching in minor league games “very soon.” Circle mid-May for his MLB debut.

"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

The indictment doesn’t mention the links to the Georgia government, information USA TODAY, the Savannah Morning News and the Augusta Chronicle pieced together from public records and a review of social media posts.

Related video: Sex trafficking skyrocketed during the pandemic. Here's why.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"Ron Johnson’s approval ratings are underwater in a swing state that President Joe Biden won.

Instead of moving to the center, though, as he faces reelection this fall, the Wisconsin senator has become the face of conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the 2020 election in the Senate. He has said that gargling mouthwash can kill the coronavirus, Jan. 6 was a mostly “peaceful protest,” and unvaccinated people around the world are being sent “basically into internment camps.”

For a vulnerable senator staring down a tough campaign, the string of head-turning remarks seem to defy political logic. But it turns out that Johnson’s shoot-from-the-lip style is a feature, not a bug, of his campaign for a third term. GOP strategists and officials say his unfiltered remarks are generating enthusiasm among a party base conditioned by Donald Trump, and appealing to independents who loathe Washington.

“He’s still perceived as an outsider. He’s not part of the GOP establishment in D.C., he never has been, and Wisconsinites like that,” said Bill McCoshen, a Wisconsin-based Republican strategist, who is not working on the race. “They may not agree with what he says every time, but they like the fact that he’s willing to speak his mind, and he’s not politically correct.”



Even Democrats largely aren’t campaigning this year against the controversial comments Johnson has made, instead focusing on the senator’s alleged self-dealing in Washington in an attempt to strip him of the non-politician veneer that helped him win past elections.

“Kellyanne Conway was right when she said voters vote on what affects them, not what offends them,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “But nobody likes being ripped off by someone who's out to serve themselves. And that's the core of our message.”

Despite Johnson’s hard turn to the right, this closely watched contest that could determine party control of the Senate is a coin flip, according to both Democratic and GOP consultants — a reflection of the fact that Republicans across the country face an extremely favorable political environment.

Story continues

Yet at the same time that he has served up red meat for the base, he’s also hedged his bets by presenting a softer side in TV ads in past elections. Johnson is replicating that playbook in this year’s midterm election.

He has run spots this campaign that highlight the Joseph Project, a program Johnson co-founded with the late African American Pastor Jerome Smith Sr., to help people in Milwaukee find jobs. One features Smith’s widow, Markeitha Smith, who attests, “I never would have thought that Ron Johnson would have ever been somebody who I can say is family. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, he actually came here.’”



In his successful bid in 2016, Johnson aired similar commercials on the initiative. His other positive spots this year are emotional testimonials from people who said his “Right to Try” legislation — which allows those with life-threatening diseases or conditions to try experimental drugs — saved their or their loved ones’ lives.

“It shows a more sensitive side to somebody who’s been working out in Washington, D.C. for the last 12 years,” said Brandon Scholz, former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party. “Instead, somebody’s on the local news talking about helping people and jobs in a place you wouldn’t expect to see Ron Johnson, in center city Milwaukee.”

A Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who worked on the 2016 Senate race, in which Johnson defeated former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, said Johnson has won in the past because he excited GOP diehards on right-wing radio while also appealing to white suburban women with his TV ads.

“Ron Johnson has been consistently underestimated as a candidate,” the person said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. “He has figured out how to be different people to different audiences.”

In regards to his comments about Covid-19, Johnson has said previously that he did not mean that mouthwash should be an alternative to the vaccine, and his office pointed to an Australian quarantine site when asked about his internment camp remarks. Speaking about the Capitol riot, while he downplayed the events of Jan. 6, he condemned the violence that day.

The case that Johnson can win reelection this year rests in part on a standout number — he outperformed Trump in 2016 by 74,000 votes, including in Milwaukee and Dane counties, where Madison is located, as well as in suburban Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, or “WOW,” counties, reliably GOP areas where Trump experienced some slippage in 2020.

Republicans are also counting on Johnson to benefit from voters turning against Democrats nationally. In Wisconsin, 52 percent of voters disapprove of Biden's performance, while 43 percent approve, according to a Marquette Law School poll in February.

GOP strategists said Johnson has shown the ability to unify the MAGA base and more old-school Republicans in the suburbs, while also picking up anti-establishment independents. In Wisconsin, they said, many swing voters are not traditional moderates, but instead are more defined by their loathing of Washington and the state capitol.

In commercials in his previous campaigns, Johnson leaned into being the only manufacturer in a sea of lawyers in the Senate.

“Ron Johnson is truly his own man. He could say anything tomorrow, and you could call me and I’d say, ‘I had no idea he was going to say that,’” said a person close to Johnson. “That’s full of risk and that’s full of hand-wringing by the establishment Republicans and it’s full of alarm-ringing by the media. And it’s also full of authenticity with voters, including swing voters, not just the base.”



At the same time that Trump lost his second bid in Wisconsin, Republican congressional candidates in total also outperformed the then-president by more than 50,000 votes — evidence of the willingness of some conservative and swing voters to cast their ballots for those in the GOP not named Trump.

Still, Democrats view the race as a top opportunity to pick up a Republican-held seat. After nearly a dozen years in the Senate, they think they can pierce Johnson’s image as an outsider businessman. In fact, they think it’s already been popped: Johnson is viewed unfavorably by 45 percent of voters, compared to 33 percent who see him favorably, according to the recent Marquette poll. Twenty-one percent said they hadn’t heard enough about Johnson or didn’t know.

“I think it is entirely possible that Democrats have a bad night nationally, and Ron Johnson still loses,” said Joe Zepecki, a Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who is not working for any Senate candidate. “That's how much trouble I really genuinely believe that he's in here.”

Democrats have seized on a plan to paint Johnson as self-serving for pushing for a provision in Trump’s tax bill that benefited his own company and campaign donors. In 2017, Johnson held his vote for the legislation until he secured a bigger tax cut for “pass-through” entities, arguing that small businesses would be undercut at the expense of corporations otherwise.

Opportunity Wisconsin, an anti-Johnson group, has aired more than $3 million of negative ads hitting him for “passing tax laws that benefit himself.” And Democrats think he recently put his foot in his mouth in a way that makes their case for them. At a meeting with GOP activists this month, Johnson was asked how to fight back against attacks about the tax bill.

“Now, did my business benefit? Sure,” Johnson said. “Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits.”

Jake Wilkins, a spokesperson for Johnson, defended his advocacy for the tax legislation as “single-handedly keeping small businesses competitive with the big guys by insisting on tax cuts for everyone.”

Wilkins also touted the senator’s work on the Joseph Project and Right to Try: “Based on what he has accomplished, Senator Johnson believes he is in a strong position to win reelection. His strategy will be to do what he has consistently done: work hard and simply tell the truth.”

Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin native and anti-Trump ex-Republican, previously supported Johnson but now compares him to Joseph McCarthy, the former Wisconsin senator who led a demagogic red-baiting campaign.

“Johnson should be the most vulnerable Republican in the country,” he said. But given the political mood, the race “leans Republican, even as unpopular as Johnson is, unless the Democrats can really get their act together.”",Holly Otterbein,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-johnson-pursues-scorched-earth-083000728.html,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,Yahoo
"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

REWIND: Missed call leaves Detroit's Armando Galarraga one out shy of perfect game

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

Monmouth University students (clockwise, from upper left) Antonio Bulzomi, Hannah Latshaw, Gabriella Griffo and Georgia Watkins

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Roseanne Barr has a lengthy list of controversies over her decades in the business. Though the scandals show no sign of stopping, after the cancellation of her Roseanne revival the comic has had little-to-no platform to let ‘er rip. One cannot have controversies without an audience, which, apart from her active YouTube Channel, Barr has lost almost entirely. Until now.

With the release of her Reelz documentary Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, she’s back, spewing her Trump rhetoric and blasting all the haters. The film, which wastes no time making a martyr of the actress, allows Barr to take one final stand against her cancellation. The likes of Mo’Nique, Howie Mandel and her Roseanne executive producer Allan Stephan all participate, offering kind words about their pal while she also defends herself.

For the most part, Barr spends her hour and a half attempting to reconcile her racist tweet aimed at White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “I shoulda not did it, but by God, I was really pissed that day,” Barr says. Returning to her original defense—the pills made her do it—she continues: “I did something I wouldn’t do if I hadn’t been on that Ambien. It makes you do a lot of crazy shit.”

Roseanne Barr: #MeToo Women are Hos, But Trump is a ‘Deep Thinker’

The original tweet, which resulted in the swift cancellation of the Roseanne reboot, read “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in a response to another tweet about Jarrett. In the doc, Barr and her closest allies unpack the night as it unfolded, starting with her attempting to “do the worst thing” she could do to piss off her producers.

Soon after, Barr received a phone call. Johnny Argent, the star’s longtime boyfriend, recalls hearing her shout, “Racist?! Iran isn’t a fucking race, you fucking idiot!”

Barr says that just 40 minutes after the tweet, her show was canceled. “I was called a racist,” she says in the doc, more upset with the world than herself. “It was politically expedient for them to shit on my name.”

Story continues

Everyone interviewed in the doc continues to use the same excuse: Barr simply thought that Jarrett was white, and the Planet of the Apes comment was about anarchy in the Middle East. Sure. Still, her boyfriend pleads that “there’s not a racist bone in this woman’s body.”

After the tweet was unleashed, Barr attempted to clean up after herself by blaming Ambien, claiming that she didn’t know Jarrett’s race, and demanding to go on The View. But it was no use: Barr would be killed off of her own show, which was later spun into The Conners.

Roseanne Barr’s Daughter on Dealing With Mom’s Affair, Secret Daughter, and Racist Tweet

“Witch-burning is what it is,” Barr says. “Intellectual witch-burning, and arrogance and ignorance. All of the press of the United States and the world, how they interpreted my tweet without any knowledge of the fact that I was sending it to a journalist in Iran about what was happening to the people in Iran. We’re under such terrible censorship. It’s just terrible and frightening.”

As much as Barr would like to pin the dilemma on “witch-burning,” the fact is, her family and coworkers apparently attempted to yank the phone from her grip to get her to stop tweeting. While the comic spent every day of the 2016 election publicly expressing her loyalty to Donald Trump, the production team behind Roseanne would repeatedly tell her to take tweets down.

Roseanne Barr Regrets Apologizing to Valerie Jarrett, Argues Her Tweet Was ‘Not Racist’

“Everyone was begging me to give up my Twitter. Everyone,” Barr recalls. “My kids were trying to lock me out, but I wouldn’t! Because it’s like, I just couldn’t. I’m a goddamn American, I’m not going to do it. I’m a comic, I’m a bad girl, I’m too rock ’n’ roll. I’m going to say fuck it and fuck you ’til I take my last breath.”

Naturally, coming into the writers’ room guns a-blazin’, issues arose around every corner for the staff. Argent claims that the writers’ room “would not accept” Barr’s pro-Trump mentality, and others who worked on the production side claim that she was a “volatile character” and that “a lot of people had a difficult time with her.”

All in all, it definitely sounds like there were many factors leading up to the cancellation of Roseanne and the removal of Barr from her series. Diehard fans, however, shouldn’t worry:Yyou can still catch the comic whining about honey and interviewing staunch conservatives on her free YouTube channel.

Or, perhaps, check out Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, which will air on Reelz on April 24 at 8 p.m. ET.

"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

A dad-to-be was less than thrilled to learn that his wife was pregnant with their third daughter, provoking some strong opinions on the matter.

The footage, originally uploaded by the mom, @kc.fulton, gained over 42 million views on TikTok — but it gained even more traction when it was posted to Twitter by user @notcapnamerica.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a dad has gone viral for throwing a tantrum at a gender reveal party, but considering the backlash this footage has been receiving, it might be the last.

Twitter user @notcapnamerica gained over 10,000 replies when he posted the TikTok video with the caption, “Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this?”

In the video, we see the Fulton family gathered together for a gender reveal photo shoot. With her husband and two daughters by her side, @kc.fulton lifts an umbrella above her head and opens it — showering the family with a flurry of bright pink petals.

As the mom and daughters squeal with delight, Dad angrily shouts and curses, eventually walking out of frame altogether. Eventually, he crosses back into the video, only to cuss angrily again.

“I swear he’s happy,” the caption reads.

“He’s acting like a 2-year-old. I wouldn’t post this at all. I’d also stop having kids with him too. Babies are blessings. Period,” one user commented.

“I think the marriage would be over for me right at that moment,” another comment read.

“Same vibe with gender reveals when dad jumps up and down and gets excited because, finally, A BOY!!!” wrote another user.

“I hate this. Telling your daughter you don’t want her or [that] she already disappointed you before she was born. Don’t have kids if you are going to continue to burden them with impossible expectations,” replied one user.

“I hope the [baby] that’s coming never sees this. This is awful,” another comment read.

Since going viral, @kc.fulton has disabled comments on the controversial video. But in a follow-up video, she insists that her husband “loves ALL of his girls and they love him.”

“He has loved his babies since the second he found out we were having them! He IS a good dad,” the caption reads.

Let’s hope all three Fulton girls — and every daughter around the world — will be celebrated and loved all their lives.

That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day. However, if you experience any negative side effects—like the ones associated with hyponatremia—slow down your rate of water consumption immediately, Lund advises.

"Coachella is a popular destination for influencers and Instagram fanatics. Callie Ahlgrim

Coachella in Indio, California, is one of the most famous music festivals.

Insider's music team found the reality was not exactly how it appeared on social media.

It's dusty, the food is expensive, and much of the day is spent sitting or weaving through crowds.

The first taste of the festival is not very picturesque.

Day parking at Coachella is free. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk from the parking lot is long, tedious, and extremely dusty.

Preferred parking costs $140 plus fees. Callie Ahlgrim

Festival workers try to reduce dust with water, but that often creates mud puddles.

It can take 20 to 30 minutes to reach the festival grounds from single-day parking lots. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk back is even worse.

Most headline performances end well past midnight. Callie Ahlgrim

Many people got lost trying to find their cars and were forced to cut through unmarked areas.

On the first day, there wasn't enough signage to help patrons find their way. Callie Ahlgrim

Some people took off their shoes because their feet had become so sore.

Cowboy boots were a popular footwear option at Coachella this year. Callie Ahlgrim

People who are over 21 receive a special wristband that must be renewed each day. Callie Ahlgrim

The line to buy merchandise is especially grueling.

Some people waited for more than two hours to buy merch. Callie Ahlgrim

You could wait 40 minutes or more to buy overpriced food.

There is classic fast food available, as well as vegan options. Callie Ahlgrim

This slice of cheese pizza cost $11.

It was OK. Callie Ahlgrim

This order of fries and onion rings cost $26.

The dipping sauces were free. Callie Ahlgrim

There are very few tables and seating areas, so people typically end up eating on the ground.

It's hard to find proper seating at Coachella if you don't have access to VIP areas. Callie Ahlgrim

In fact, people spend far more time sitting on the ground than you might expect.

People sat on the grass to watch Finneas perform. Callie Ahlgrim

The sun is so strong that people skip shows and activities just to sit in the shade.

There are art installations and structures that provide some relief from the sun. Callie Ahlgrim

It's so hot that some people can't bear to go near the stage, even if they want to watch the performance.

"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

The indictment doesn’t mention the links to the Georgia government, information USA TODAY, the Savannah Morning News and the Augusta Chronicle pieced together from public records and a review of social media posts.

Related video: Sex trafficking skyrocketed during the pandemic. Here's why.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Roseanne Barr has a lengthy list of controversies over her decades in the business. Though the scandals show no sign of stopping, after the cancellation of her Roseanne revival the comic has had little-to-no platform to let ‘er rip. One cannot have controversies without an audience, which, apart from her active YouTube Channel, Barr has lost almost entirely. Until now.

With the release of her Reelz documentary Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, she’s back, spewing her Trump rhetoric and blasting all the haters. The film, which wastes no time making a martyr of the actress, allows Barr to take one final stand against her cancellation. The likes of Mo’Nique, Howie Mandel and her Roseanne executive producer Allan Stephan all participate, offering kind words about their pal while she also defends herself.

For the most part, Barr spends her hour and a half attempting to reconcile her racist tweet aimed at White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “I shoulda not did it, but by God, I was really pissed that day,” Barr says. Returning to her original defense—the pills made her do it—she continues: “I did something I wouldn’t do if I hadn’t been on that Ambien. It makes you do a lot of crazy shit.”

Roseanne Barr: #MeToo Women are Hos, But Trump is a ‘Deep Thinker’

The original tweet, which resulted in the swift cancellation of the Roseanne reboot, read “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in a response to another tweet about Jarrett. In the doc, Barr and her closest allies unpack the night as it unfolded, starting with her attempting to “do the worst thing” she could do to piss off her producers.

Soon after, Barr received a phone call. Johnny Argent, the star’s longtime boyfriend, recalls hearing her shout, “Racist?! Iran isn’t a fucking race, you fucking idiot!”

Barr says that just 40 minutes after the tweet, her show was canceled. “I was called a racist,” she says in the doc, more upset with the world than herself. “It was politically expedient for them to shit on my name.”

Story continues

Everyone interviewed in the doc continues to use the same excuse: Barr simply thought that Jarrett was white, and the Planet of the Apes comment was about anarchy in the Middle East. Sure. Still, her boyfriend pleads that “there’s not a racist bone in this woman’s body.”

After the tweet was unleashed, Barr attempted to clean up after herself by blaming Ambien, claiming that she didn’t know Jarrett’s race, and demanding to go on The View. But it was no use: Barr would be killed off of her own show, which was later spun into The Conners.

Roseanne Barr’s Daughter on Dealing With Mom’s Affair, Secret Daughter, and Racist Tweet

“Witch-burning is what it is,” Barr says. “Intellectual witch-burning, and arrogance and ignorance. All of the press of the United States and the world, how they interpreted my tweet without any knowledge of the fact that I was sending it to a journalist in Iran about what was happening to the people in Iran. We’re under such terrible censorship. It’s just terrible and frightening.”

As much as Barr would like to pin the dilemma on “witch-burning,” the fact is, her family and coworkers apparently attempted to yank the phone from her grip to get her to stop tweeting. While the comic spent every day of the 2016 election publicly expressing her loyalty to Donald Trump, the production team behind Roseanne would repeatedly tell her to take tweets down.

Roseanne Barr Regrets Apologizing to Valerie Jarrett, Argues Her Tweet Was ‘Not Racist’

“Everyone was begging me to give up my Twitter. Everyone,” Barr recalls. “My kids were trying to lock me out, but I wouldn’t! Because it’s like, I just couldn’t. I’m a goddamn American, I’m not going to do it. I’m a comic, I’m a bad girl, I’m too rock ’n’ roll. I’m going to say fuck it and fuck you ’til I take my last breath.”

Naturally, coming into the writers’ room guns a-blazin’, issues arose around every corner for the staff. Argent claims that the writers’ room “would not accept” Barr’s pro-Trump mentality, and others who worked on the production side claim that she was a “volatile character” and that “a lot of people had a difficult time with her.”

All in all, it definitely sounds like there were many factors leading up to the cancellation of Roseanne and the removal of Barr from her series. Diehard fans, however, shouldn’t worry:Yyou can still catch the comic whining about honey and interviewing staunch conservatives on her free YouTube channel.

Or, perhaps, check out Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, which will air on Reelz on April 24 at 8 p.m. ET.

"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

A dad-to-be was less than thrilled to learn that his wife was pregnant with their third daughter, provoking some strong opinions on the matter.

The footage, originally uploaded by the mom, @kc.fulton, gained over 42 million views on TikTok — but it gained even more traction when it was posted to Twitter by user @notcapnamerica.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a dad has gone viral for throwing a tantrum at a gender reveal party, but considering the backlash this footage has been receiving, it might be the last.

Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/ki3arQ2SgB — chris evans (@notcapnamerica) April 14, 2022

Twitter user @notcapnamerica gained over 10,000 replies when he posted the TikTok video with the caption, “Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this?”

In the video, we see the Fulton family gathered together for a gender reveal photo shoot. With her husband and two daughters by her side, @kc.fulton lifts an umbrella above her head and opens it — showering the family with a flurry of bright pink petals.

As the mom and daughters squeal with delight, Dad angrily shouts and curses, eventually walking out of frame altogether. Eventually, he crosses back into the video, only to cuss angrily again.

“I swear he’s happy,” the caption reads.

‘I think the marriage would be over for me…’

Viewers didn’t hold back in their response to @notcapnamerica‘s question.

“It’s so ugly. I would never post the video,” one Twitter user wrote.

“He’s acting like a 2-year-old. I wouldn’t post this at all. I’d also stop having kids with him too. Babies are blessings. Period,” one user commented.

“I think the marriage would be over for me right at that moment,” another comment read.

“Same vibe with gender reveals when dad jumps up and down and gets excited because, finally, A BOY!!!” wrote another user.

“I hate this. Telling your daughter you don’t want her or [that] she already disappointed you before she was born. Don’t have kids if you are going to continue to burden them with impossible expectations,” replied one user.

“I hope the [baby] that’s coming never sees this. This is awful,” another comment read.

Since going viral, @kc.fulton has disabled comments on the controversial video. But in a follow-up video, she insists that her husband “loves ALL of his girls and they love him.”

“He has loved his babies since the second he found out we were having them! He IS a good dad,” the caption reads.

Let’s hope all three Fulton girls — and every daughter around the world — will be celebrated and loved all their lives.

These days, it seems you can barely go anywhere without hearing about the benefits of staying hydrated, especially as an athlete. And as much as I know that I need to drink a lot of water, staying on top of it just slips my mind. It’s not that I don’t drink any water, it’s just nowhere near a gallon of water a day—I usually drink one 25-ounce bottle and maybe a can of LaCroix.



That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day. However, if you experience any negative side effects—like the ones associated with hyponatremia—slow down your rate of water consumption immediately, Lund advises.

"Coachella is a popular destination for influencers and Instagram fanatics. Callie Ahlgrim

Coachella in Indio, California, is one of the most famous music festivals.

Insider's music team found the reality was not exactly how it appeared on social media.

It's dusty, the food is expensive, and much of the day is spent sitting or weaving through crowds.

The first taste of the festival is not very picturesque.

Day parking at Coachella is free. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk from the parking lot is long, tedious, and extremely dusty.

Preferred parking costs $140 plus fees. Callie Ahlgrim

Festival workers try to reduce dust with water, but that often creates mud puddles.

It can take 20 to 30 minutes to reach the festival grounds from single-day parking lots. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk back is even worse.

Most headline performances end well past midnight. Callie Ahlgrim

Many people got lost trying to find their cars and were forced to cut through unmarked areas.

On the first day, there wasn't enough signage to help patrons find their way. Callie Ahlgrim

Some people took off their shoes because their feet had become so sore.

Cowboy boots were a popular footwear option at Coachella this year. Callie Ahlgrim

Lines at the festival are always long.

People who are over 21 receive a special wristband that must be renewed each day. Callie Ahlgrim

The line to buy merchandise is especially grueling.

Some people waited for more than two hours to buy merch. Callie Ahlgrim

You could wait 40 minutes or more to buy overpriced food.

There is classic fast food available, as well as vegan options. Callie Ahlgrim

This slice of cheese pizza cost $11.

It was OK. Callie Ahlgrim

This order of fries and onion rings cost $26.

The dipping sauces were free. Callie Ahlgrim

There are very few tables and seating areas, so people typically end up eating on the ground.

It's hard to find proper seating at Coachella if you don't have access to VIP areas. Callie Ahlgrim

In fact, people spend far more time sitting on the ground than you might expect.

People sat on the grass to watch Finneas perform. Callie Ahlgrim

The sun is so strong that people skip shows and activities just to sit in the shade.

There are art installations and structures that provide some relief from the sun. Callie Ahlgrim

It's so hot that some people can't bear to go near the stage, even if they want to watch the performance.

Coachella's Outdoor Theatre stage. Callie Ahlgrim

It can also be difficult to get close to the stage thanks to massive VIP sections, which are closed to regular patrons.

Coachella's Mojave stage. Callie Ahlgrim

Much of the day is spent weaving through crowds.

Coachella's Gobi stage. Callie Ahlgrim

Those crowds leave trash everywhere.

Throughout the day, workers can be seen picking up discarded bottles and food items. Callie Ahlgrim

The experience can be overwhelming and exhausting.

Some people just sleep on the ground. Callie Ahlgrim

"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released their income tax returns last week. The first couple reported $610,702 in adjusted gross income and paid $150,439 in federal income tax at an effective tax rate of 24.6%.

While it’s unclear what former president Donald Trump’s income or tax bill was for 2021, we can compare Biden’s 2017 federal tax return with the data The New York Times reported on regarding Trump’s income tax payment in 2017.

Biden’s 2017 tax return showed $11,031,309 in adjusted gross income and a federal tax payment of $3,553,249. The New York Times reported that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes that year, the same as he paid in 2016.

According to The New York Times, the former president’s various businesses lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the previous 20 years, allowing him to reduce his federal tax obligation to almost nothing.

Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported by the Times. However, assumptions can be made based on Trump’s largest business venture - his real estate holdings.

Real Estate Tax Benefits

Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write off depreciation against income. In fact, it’s quite common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while actually receiving positive cash flow for the year.

This tax strategy can be seen across almost all equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, Piedmont Office Realty Trust (NYSE: PDM) reported a net loss of nearly $1.2 million for 2021, which included a $120.6 million expense for depreciation and amortization. The company’s actual funds from operations (FFO) was $245.4 million.

While the company’s tax returns showed a loss, it was actually able to pay out over $104 million to its shareholders for the year in dividends.

Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward. Companies, such as The Trump Organization, can carry losses over from one year to offset taxes in subsequent years. Trump used this strategy after realizing nearly $1 billion in losses in the early 90s. He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005.

Joe Biden’s 2017 income, on the other hand, was mainly earned through speaking engagements and book deals, neither of which offers the same tax advantages as real estate.

How Individuals Use This Tax Strategy

Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class. Investors can even take advantage of these tax benefits without having to purchase a skyscraper, hotel or apartment complex themselves.

Passive investments as a limited partner through private equity real estate deals can provide many of the same benefits. Investors that take part in a direct real estate investment through a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income, or loss, after deducting expenses like depreciation.

It’s not uncommon for investors to receive cash distributions throughout the year, then be able to show a loss on their tax returns.

It’s important to understand that each individual’s situation is different when it comes to income taxes and not all private equity real estate investments have the same pass-through tax structure. It’s always a good idea to consult with a certified public accountant to determine how a particular investment will affect your unique tax situation.

"How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stocks at a profit, you will owe taxes on those gains. Depending on how long you’ve owned the stock, you may owe at your regular income tax rate or at the capital gains rate, which is usually lower than the former. To pay taxes you owe on stock sales, use IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D. A financial advisor who serves your area can help you with tax planning for your investments and retirement.

The Basics on How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stock for less you bought it for, you won’t owe any income tax on the losses. In fact, you may be able to use this loss to reduce your taxes. If you sell stock for more than you paid, however, you’ll have a profit and may need to pay taxes on that gain.

If you’ve owned the stock for less than a year before selling it at a profit, you’ll owe taxes on it at your regular income tax rate. If you owned the stocks for more than a year, the long-term capital gains tax rates apply. These rates are dependent on your overall income, but may be 0%, 15% or 20%.

You can use SmartAsset’s capital gains calculator to estimate the taxes you’ll owe. The calculator can also figure the estimated capital gains taxes on profits from sales of other assets, such as real estate, collectibles and cryptocurrency.

A basic strategy for reducing taxes on stock sale profits is to hold stocks that have appreciated since purchase for at least a year before selling them. This ensures profits on stock sales will be taxed at the usually lower capital gains rate. Another approach is to sell stocks that have declined in value in order to generate a loss that can be used to shelter gains.

Note that whether you owe income taxes at your regular rate or the capital gains rate, you don’t owe Social Security or Medicare taxes on gain from sales of stocks. Investment income, including profits from stock sales as well as dividends and interest, is considered passive income and does not pay these taxes. However, passive income is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

Using IRS Form 8949 to Pay Taxes on Your Stocks

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Whether you show a profit or a loss, you’ll report stock sales on IRS Form 8949. This is the tax form used for reporting sales or exchanges of any capital assets not reported elsewhere. The information about stock sales needed on your Form 8949 should come from a Form 1099-B issued by the brokerage you are using. This will identify the stock, the dates it was acquired and sold, the sale price and cost of the stock, the profit or loss and any federal or state income taxes that were withheld. The IRS and state taxing authorities will also get a copy of the 1099-B. If you don’t get a 1099-B from your brokerage for some reason, use your own records to fill out Form 8949.

Form 8949 has two parts. The first is for short-term transactions on assets held less than a year. To fill out each part, on the first line enter the information for each stock you sold under the appropriate column. You’ll provide the stock name and number of shares, purchase and sale dates, sale price, cost and profit or loss.

You won’t usually need to enter anything in the columns for adjustments. See the instructions for Form 8949 for details. At the bottom of the form total the amounts in the columns for sale price, cost and profit or loss.

On the second part of the form, enter the same information for sales of assets held for more than a year.

Filling Out Schedule D

Schedule D is one of the schedules that are part of Form 1040. After filling out Form 8949, taxpayers transfer the totals to Schedule D. From this they can generate the overall gain or loss from stock transactions.

Like Form 8949, Schedule D also separates transactions into long- and short-term gains. The difference is still based on whether the asset was owned for a year or less.

The totals from Schedule D get transferred to the taxpayer’s 1040 on line 7. Also, any tax that the brokerage withheld when the stock was sold will be reported on Form 1040. You can learn more from the IRS instructions for Schedule D.

Bottom Line

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Investors who buy and sell stocks will reports the gains and losses to the IRS on Form 1040 using Form 8949 and Schedule D. These forms separate stock sale profits into long- and short-term capital gains. The difference between them is that long-term gains are taxed at the potentially lower capital gains rate, while investors pay taxes on short-term gains at their regular tax rates, which are usually higher.

Tax Planning Tips

Crafting a tax-efficient strategy to make the most of your investment gains can benefit from the assistance of a financial advisor. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you’re ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.

"Not even inflation can diminish the dominance of Tiger Woods.

The latest reminder came at Hilton Head when Jordan Spieth overcame an 18-inch miss on Saturday and a three-shot deficit on Sunday to beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his 13th career PGA Tour victory.

Along with a tartan jacket (he looks better in green) and a spot in the winners-only field at Kapalua next January (a big perk to him), Spieth earned $1,440,000. That made him the 11th player in PGA Tour history to cross the $50 million mark in career earnings.

Officially, he is the youngest player at 28 years and 9 months to reach $50 million.

That's where inflation comes in.

Woods is the only other player to reach $50 million in career tour earnings before turning 30. He was 29 and 6 months when he was runner-up at the Western Open in 2005, pushing him over a milestone that he quickly left in the rearview mirror.

Woods needed only seven more years to cross $100 million, and now he is at $120,895,206.

Spieth was among a half-dozen players who inconspicuously leaned over the railing from the second floor of PGA Tour headquarters last month to watch as Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He would be quick to acknowledge that a number like $50 million wouldn't even exist without Woods.

Yes, there was a significant difference in purses.

Total prize money when Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996 was $65.95 million. Spieth turned pro in 2013 — like Woods, without a tour card — and the total prize fund was $260 million.

While both reached $50 million in roughly nine years, Woods did it in 41 fewer tournaments (177 compared with 218 for Spieth). The average total prize money for Woods during that stretch was $173.8 million. For Spieth, it was $322.56 million.

Rory McIlroy is a better comparison. He turned pro nearly six years before Spieth and has kept a global schedule with membership on two tours. McIlroy needed only 173 events on the PGA Tour to reach $50 million at Bay Hill in 2020, about six weeks before he turned 31.

Story continues

Scores are coming down and prize money is going up. Such is the evolution of sport. The best measure will always be victories.

Woods has 82 on the PGA Tour alone — 11 more on tours in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe — and 15 majors. Those are the numbers that define him. When he passed $50 million, Woods already had 43 tour victories.

Money still matters, though not entirely to Woods. He was asked at Riviera a few months ago if he knew how much was in his deferred compensation package.

“Nope. Uh-uh,” he said.

Does he want to know?

“Uh-uh,” he said.

Still, this can be added to his long list of feats that might never be matched, right up there with 142 consecutive cuts and needing only seven starts to qualify for the Tour Championship.

Woods has been atop the PGA Tour career money list for 22 years.

It used to be a contest. Greg Norman took the lead over Tom Kite in August 1995 by winning the World Series of Golf at Firestone, and he kept it until the last week in January 2000 when Davis Love III moved past him after the Phoenix Open.

Love stayed on top all of two weeks until Woods was runner-up at Torrey Pines and took over. It took 73 tournaments from his “Hello, world” introduction to Woods leading the career money list, and the gap has only widened.

Spieth is not ready to declare himself all the way back — “close but far” is what he said after he won the RBC Heritage. He has two wins in just over a year, but also seven finishes out of the top 25 since winning the Texas Open last year and three missed cuts this year.

He will always be compared with how he started his career.

It was at the Valspar Championship in 2015 when Spieth, then 21 and in his third year, played a practice round with three others born the same year — Justin Thomas, Daniel Berger and Ollie Schniederjans. They lined up for a group photo from oldest to youngest, sharing birthdates to make sure they got it right. Spieth was the youngest.

This was one week after he passed $9 million in career money.

Spieth went on to win five times that year, including the Masters and U.S. Open, missing the British Open playoff by one shot and finishing second in the PGA Championship. He had a 60% rate finishing in the top 10 and set a PGA Tour record with $12,030,465 in earnings.

Woods in 2000 won nine times, including three majors. He was runner-up four times and only finished out of the top 10 three times in 20 starts. He made $9,188,321 that year.

The money keeps going up. The Players Championship paid $3.6 million to the winner — the total purse was $3.5 million the first year Woods played.

Is it enough for anyone to catch Woods?

McIlroy, who turns 33 in two weeks, is just over $59 million behind. Spieth is $70 million back, and not quite $4 million ahead of his contemporary, Justin Thomas. Dustin Johnson has just over $74 million in career earnings. He turns 38 in June.

Even with today's money, they all seem so far away. Just like always.

Woods needed only seven more years to cross $100 million, and now he is at $120,895,206.

Spieth was among a half-dozen players who inconspicuously leaned over the railing from the second floor of PGA Tour headquarters last month to watch as Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He would be quick to acknowledge that a number like $50 million wouldn’t even exist without Woods.

Yes, there was a significant difference in purses.

Total prize money when Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996 was $65.95 million. Spieth turned pro in 2013 — like Woods, without a Tour card — and the total prize fund was $260 million.

While both reached $50 million in roughly nine years, Woods did it in 41 fewer tournaments (177 compared with 218 for Spieth). The average total prize money for Woods during that stretch was $173.8 million. For Spieth, it was $322.56 million.

RBC Heritage payout: What Jordan Spieth earned and a seven-way tie for third paid

Rory McIlroy is a better comparison. He turned pro nearly six years before Spieth and has kept a global schedule with membership on two tours. McIlroy needed only 173 events on the PGA Tour to reach $50 million at Bay Hill in 2020, about six weeks before he turned 31.

Story continues

Scores are coming down and prize money is going up. Such is the evolution of sport. The best measure will always be victories.

Woods has 82 on the PGA Tour alone — 11 more on tours in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe — and 15 majors. Those are the numbers that define him. When he passed $50 million, Woods already had 43 Tour victories.

Money still matters, though not entirely to Woods. He was asked at Riviera a few months ago if he knew how much was in his deferred compensation package.

“Nope. Uh-uh,” he said.

Does he want to know?

“Uh-uh,” he said.

Still, this can be added to his long list of feats that might never be matched, right up there with 142 consecutive cuts and needing only seven starts to qualify for the Tour Championship.

Woods has been atop the PGA Tour career money list for 22 years.

It used to be a contest. Greg Norman took the lead over Tom Kite in August 1995 by winning the World Series of Golf at Firestone, and he kept it until the last week in January 2000 when Davis Love III moved past him after the Phoenix Open.

Love stayed on top all of two weeks until Woods was runner-up at Torrey Pines and took over. It took 73 tournaments from his “Hello, world” introduction to Woods leading the career money list, and the gap has only widened.

Spieth is not ready to declare himself all the way back — “close but far” is what he said after he won the RBC Heritage. He has two wins in just over a year, but also seven finishes out of the top 25 since winning the Texas Open last year and three missed cuts this year.

He will always be compared with how he started his career.

It was at the Valspar Championship in 2015 when Spieth, then 21 and in his third year, played a practice round with three others born the same year — Justin Thomas, Daniel Berger and Ollie Schniederjans. They lined up for a group photo from oldest to youngest, sharing birthdates to make sure they got it right. Spieth was the youngest.

This was one week after he passed $9 million in career money.

Spieth went on to win five times that year, including the Masters and U.S. Open, missing The Open playoff by one shot and finishing second in the PGA Championship. He had a 60% rate finishing in the top 10 and set a PGA Tour record with $12,030,465 in earnings.

Woods in 2000 won nine times, including three majors. He was runner-up four times and only finished out of the top 10 three times in 20 starts. He made $9,188,321 that year.

The money keeps going up. The Players Championship paid $3.6 million to the winner — the total purse was $3.5 million the first year Woods played.

Is it enough for anyone to catch Woods?

McIlroy, who turns 33 in two weeks, is just over $59 million behind. Spieth is $70 million back, and not quite $4 million ahead of his contemporary, Justin Thomas. Dustin Johnson has just over $74 million in career earnings. He turns 38 in June.

Even with today’s money, they all seem so far away. Just like always.",Doug Ferguson,https://sports.yahoo.com/jordan-spieth-crosses-50-million-124011406.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/mBqAEeO9hElQkmO0xjSacg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Y9asXM5Q7e9efsVzY6iSBQ--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_golf_channel_404/90602f47414f3c0754a9212fe8209162,Yahoo
"John Daly II has played exactly one tournament for the University of Arkansas and posted just a single round under par during that event, but that didn’t stop the freshman from signing a name, image, likeness deal with Hooters, an agreement that was announced on Tuesday.

The son of two-time major champ John Daly played in one tournament last fall for the Razorbacks, posting scores of 83-68-78 at the Blessings Collegiate Invitational in October.

The Dalys combined in December to win the PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, using a 36-hole total of 27-under 117 to beat Tiger and Charlie Woods. In the process, the tandem broke the previous tournament scoring record set by Davis Love III/Dru Love in 2018 by one stroke, and earned Team Daly the red-leather Willie Park winner’s belts.

Hooters has signed father-son duo John Daly and John Daly II in its first NIL agreement for a college athlete. The Dalys will promote the world-famous @Hooters brand through various marketing activities, including significant roles on social media and other digital channels. pic.twitter.com/gN2SKOP0KX — Kristi Dosh (@SportsBizMiss) April 19, 2022

Also, the younger Daly placed T-12 in the 2022 New Year’s Invitational at St. Petersburg Country Club, posting rounds of 69 and 68 in the process. That event was won by Remi Chartier of East Tennessee State. The freshman from Clearwater has seen little time in the Arkansas lineup as stars Mateo Fernández de Oliveira and Luke Long have led the way. The Razorbacks won the SEC Match Play Championship in the fall at Shoal Creek, and currently sit at No. 11 in the Golfweek/Sagarin collegiate team rankings.

The senior Daly said via Twitter that he was happy to continue the family relationship with the brand.

Story continues

“Can’t express how excited I am to be back with my @Hooters family & having my son beside me on the next generation!” he said.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Hooters is thrilled to make our long-standing relationship with John official and to enter an exciting new venture with Little John as our first NIL ambassador,” Bruce Skala, Hooters senior VP of marketing, said in a release. “John’s larger-than-life personality makes him an ideal representative of Hooters’ fun-loving spirit, while Little John will promote our brand to the next generation as one of the next big names in golf. We are ecstatic to have the Dalys, fantastic golfers and great personalities, on board as spokespeople for Hooters, the definitive 19th hole.”

NIL deals continue to make news as the stakes for college athletes is raised. For example, a five-star high school recruit in the 2023 class recently signed a name, image and likeness collective with a school that could earn him $8 million before his senior year at the college, The Athletic reported.

Since the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision in June 2021 that threw out the NCAA’s restrictions on “education-related benefits,” almost 30 states have passed legislation about NIL and its governance, despite being no federal law to oversee it.

The NCAA is expected to file a report to discuss how NIL is impacting college athletics, despite the Supreme Court ruling that “the NCAA is not above the law” in its unanimous decision.

"There were plenty of familiar faces kick-starting the festivities over the weekend in the season-opening week of the USFL. One of those faces was former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kyle Sloter.

As the leading signal caller for the New Orleans Breakers, Sloter stepped under center on Sunday and helped lead the team to a 23-17 win over the Philadelphia Stars.

Granted, the team was carried by the defense for the most part with linebacker Vontae Diggs snatching a pick-six early in the ballgame. The team also leaned heavily on the legs of running back Jordan Ellis, along with the versatile playmaking abilities of T.J. Logan Jr.

Re-watch all of his best moments 👇🌊 pic.twitter.com/kcp9v6UnBB — New Orleans Breakers (@USFLBreakers) April 18, 2022

Sloter, who was actually signed to the Vikings’ active roster last December, went 17-of-27 passing for 150 yards and one interception. So it wasn’t necessarily the big coming-out-party he hoped it would be. But the outcome played out in his favor, and he can look forward to improving in his next outing.

The 28-year-old quarterback played for six different teams during his time in the NFL, including two pit stops in Minnesota.

At the very least, it’s a positive turn of events seeing a former journeyman get some well-deserved shine as a starter in a new league.

"DALLAS (AP) — Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber and the Dallas Mavericks got even in their first-round playoff series with a bunch of a 3-pointers, their fewest turnovers ever in a postseason game, and without injured superstar Luka Doncic.

Brunson scored a career-high 41 points, Maxi Kleber had 25 with eight of their playoff-record 22 made 3-pointers and the Mavericks, with only three turnovers, beat the Utah Jazz 110-104 in Game 2 on Monday night.

In danger of dropping the first two games after opening the playoffs with home-court advantage for the first time since their NBA title 11 years ago, the Mavericks even overcame a 10-point deficit after halftime.

Kleber, who had made only 19% of his 3-point attempts since the All-Star break, was 8-of-11 from beyond the arc and put the Mavs ahead to stay with 4:21 left, then added another 3 on the next possession.

“I started this morning, I was talking to (Dorian Finney-Smith) and I told him, ‘Doe, I’m going to let 10 3s fly tonight.’ And he said, ‘That’s my dog.’ And that kind of set the tone for the day,” Kleber said. “The mindset is we know they’re going to leave certain guys open to shoot. We’ve just got to let it fly.”

Game 3 is Thursday night in Utah, where Dallas has lost its last 11 games.

“We did what we had to do, which was win tonight. But we were only focused on tonight,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “We understand what’s in front of us, what’s coming. It’s going to be a hostile environment.”

Brunson, the starting point guard with Doncic out, became the fifth Dallas player to score 40 points in a playoff game. He is the first Mavericks player to do that without committing a turnover. The other 40-point scorers were Doncic, Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman and Nick Van Exel.

Donovan Mitchell had 34 points for Utah, while Bojan Bogdanovic had 25 and Jordan Clarkson 21. Rudy Gobert had eight points and 17 rebounds.

“We tried to go out there and take both (games). Didn’t happen. You know we’re not going to overreact. We’re going to go home, and we’ve got to take care of business. Simple as that,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we’re happy we took a game and go back and take care of business.”

Story continues

Dallas had led only once in the second half until a 10-0 run capped by a go-ahead 3 by Finney-Smith and a jumper by Brunson. Royce O'Neale then hit a tying 3-pointer and Mitchell made a short jumper to put Utah back in front before Kleber's back-to-back 3s.

""The telltale is we can’t have Brunson have the night he had and also be able to kick the ball out for those looks,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “And when those passes are kicked out, I thought we weren’t as sharp mentally in our ability to rotate. And that’s something that we’ve done before.”

Doncic was still out because of a strained left calf he suffered in the regular season finale eight days earlier. Kidd said before the game that the 23-year-old All-Star was making progress, “definitely going in the right direction” and doing more each day.

Brunson, who had 24 points when the Mavs lost 99-93 in Game 1, made his first five shots — with three 3s — in the first 6 minutes.

“I’m just playing how the defense is giving me, just seeing how they’re defending certain things. Just stepping into certain shots,” Brunson said. “Yeah, the 5-of-5 start is great, but I had the same mentality when I was 0 for 5 last game, or whatever. ... You can’t fluctuate whenever, not even when (Doncic) is in or out. Because you need guys to make plays.”

TIP-INS

Jazz: Utah wiped out a five-point deficit in the final minute of of the first quarter to tie the game at 24. The sequence started with Gobert’s putback dunk. The 7-foot-1 center, the NBA’s top defensive player three of the previous four seasons who finished third for this season’s award announced earlier Monday, then had a block before a 3 from Clarkson, who initially was tripped up moving through the lane before getting up and getting the ball back in the corner.

Mavericks: The Mavs finished 21 of 41 on 3s (51.2%) and shot 50% overall (36 of 72). ... Spencer Dinwiddie had all three Dallas turnovers, two on plays that could have easily been fouls against Utah. He had 17 points and six assists. ... Dallas led the NBA during the regular season with 17 wins after coming back from deficits of at least 10 points.

SAME DRAFT

Brunson, whose previous high was 34 points during his rookie season, is in the final year of his rookie deal and is unsigned past this season. The former NCAA championship guard at Villanova was drafted in 2018, the same year as Doncic.

“He’s going to make a lot of money. I don’t know if he needs an agent, but I’ll put my name in the hat,” Kidd said, apparently not aware that Brunson has the same agent as Doncic. ""It’s not just what he did tonight. It’s not what he’s going to do going forward. He’s already done the work. He’s showing that he deserves to be paid. He does his job at a very high level, and he’s a winner.

"Tuesday, April 19, brings a robust 10-game main slate with a first pitch time of 7:10 p.m. ET on Yahoo, DraftKings and FanDuel. Let’s get into the top MLB DFS picks for pitchers and stacks for Yahoo, DraftKings and FanDuel daily fantasy baseball lineups. As always, you can head over to the Awesemo MLB DFS & Fantasy Baseball home page for all the fantasy baseball content you need for any given slate.

MLB DFS Picks Today: Spotlight Pitchers and Top Stacks | Tuesday, April 19

Yahoo Stack of the Day: Boston Red Sox vs. LHP Yusei Kikuchi — 5.0 implied runs

Yesterday the Red Sox lost the early-morning Patriot’s Day game, but they should bounce back tonight in a tasty matchup against lefty Yusei Kikuchi. The former Mariner can be exploited by right-handed hitting, which is something that Boston brings to this matchup. Trevor Story ($15) and Bobby Dalbec ($9) are steals on Yahoo tonight, along with J.D. Martinez ($18), Xander Bogaerts ($17) and Enrique “Kike” Hernandez ($17). This will be a popular stack, though there are plenty of other ways to find roster differentiation with a 20-team player pool.

Late Slate: Oakland Athletics vs. Baltimore Orioles — 4.3 implied runs

The Orioles have not yet announced a starter for tonight, so we could be looking at a bullpen game — or a minor league callup. Either way, the longer the uncertainty lasts, the longer the Athletics will stay under the radar. Somehow, Oakland is tied for the league lead with 58 runs scored, putting it in the same lofty tier as the Dodgers. There will be regression at some point, as half of the A’s lineup consists of replacement-level players, but until that happens, we need to follow the infamous words of Crash Davis and “Respect the streak.” Sean Murphy and Seth Brown are the above-average options, and then players such as Billy McKinney, Elvis Andrus and Tony Kemp can be feathered in for differentiation. There is no need to go overboard with four- or five-man stacks, but using duos and trios from the Athletics does provide some discounted upside potential on all slates.

Spotlight Pitchers

Top MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Corbin Burnes vs. Pittsburgh Pirates — 2.9 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $58 | FanDuel $10,800 | DraftKings $10,500

Yahoo has broken its soft pitching salary cap of $55 for the reigning National League Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes. The matchup against a watered-down Pirates squad is one of the best any pitcher will get this season. There will be enough discount dandies finding their way into lineups tonight that employing Burnes as an ace should not be an issue. Through two starts, Burnes has logged a dozen innings with as many strikeouts, allowing just three earned runs. Over the last two seasons, the projected Pittsburgh lineup has been dreadful against right-handed hurlers, with a 0.272 wOBA, 0.068 ISO and a 6.0% walk rate. Enjoy!

Secondary MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Joe Musgrove vs. Cincinnati Reds — 3.2 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $50 | FanDuel $11,000 | DraftKings $8,600

The DraftKings salary algorithm is giving a nice discount for Joe Musgrove in a matchup against a patchwork Cincinnati squad. FanDuel went a little overboard, though; with its loose salaries, it is not too difficult to roster Musgrove. The Reds are without Nick Castellanos, Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez, who are all playing for new teams. Mike Moustakas is day-to-day with an arm injury, and Tyler Naquin was placed on the injured list Monday. That means Joey Votto will be the lone above-average lefty in the lineup with Jake Fraley and Colin Moran likely joining him, along with their elevated strikeout rates. In his last 117 same-handed matchups, Aristides Aquino has struck out 48.7% of the time. While Tommy Pham rolled up a three-hit game against his former squad last night, including a double and a home run, his best days are well behind him. Things are looking good for Musgrove tonight, and he should be rostered with confidence.

Wild Card MLB DFS Picks Target: LHP Cole Irvin vs. Baltimore Orioles — 3.7 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $29 | FanDuel $7,100 | DraftKings $6,300

Today’s wild card is lefty Cole Irvin, who has both an appealing matchup and salary on Yahoo and DraftKings, where two pitchers are required for each lineup. Baltimore does project to put in nearly a full complement of right-handed hitters against Irving tonight, and while it do have above-average power (.207 ISO) that comes with a lot of strikeout (25.7%) upside. While Irvin has below-average strikeout stuff, he has solid control allowing very few walks and extra-base hits. When looking to a low-upside pitcher like Irvin, it is important to also account for how the salary relief he provides can be employed across the remainder of the lineup.

Final MLB DFS Thoughts & Weather Notes for the Tuesday, April 19 Fantasy Baseball Slate

Tuesday brings a brief respite from the precipitation we saw on Monday. Most outdoor venues in the Midwest and East Coast are still experiencing cold and likely will for the next two or three weeks. The White Sox at Guardians game in Cleveland was postponed, though with the 6:10 p.m. ET start time it was not represented on many Tuesday slates.

Send any and all complaints to me on Twitter: @drewsilv.

Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.

1. Los Angeles Dodgers

Record: 8-2

Last Week: 3

It’s quite fitting that Freddie Freeman connected for his first Dodgers home run in his first at-bat of the night Monday against the visiting Braves. The solo shot to left-center put Los Angeles up 1-0 in the bottom of the first, and Freeman also scored a run following a walk in the bottom of the fourth. All part of a 7-4 victory, the Dodgers’ seventh straight victory since they lost two games at Colorado’s Coors Field over opening weekend. This team is stacked with talent and now fully hitting its stride.

2. Toronto Blue Jays

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 1

There’s no shame in being leapfrogged by the streaking Dodgers. Toronto has yet to lose a series this season, having taken two of three from the Rangers to open things up, then splitting a four-game set at Yankee Stadium, before grabbing another two of three against the A’s over the weekend. Teoscar Hernandez will be sorely missed as he recovers from a left oblique strain. The 29-year-old has batted .295/.347/.538 with 49 homers and 153 RBI in 199 games since the beginning of 2020.

3. New York Mets

Record: 7-3

Last Week: 4

Tylor Megill will take the bump in the first half of Tuesday’s doubleheader versus the Giants following a rainout in Queens on Monday. Essentially the fill-in for Jacob deGrom, Megill has looked very deGrom-like in the early going with a 0.00 ERA, 0.58 WHIP, and 11/0 K/BB ratio in two starts covering 10 1/3 innings. Francisco Lindor is well on his way to a big-time fantasy bounceback, boasting a 1.048 OPS with three homers, seven RBI, two steals, and nine runs scored in 10 games.

Story continues

4. Chicago White Sox

Record: 6-3

Last Week: 5

Already looking like a runaway favorite in the AL Central, the White Sox have won all three of their series so far against the Tigers, Mariners, and Rays. Dylan Cease, the defacto ace with Lance Lynn (knee) and Lucas Giolito (abdomen) on the shelf, is 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA and 16 strikeouts over 10 2/3 innings. Tim Anderson has batted .393 with a 1.021 OPS through 29 plate appearances since missing the first two games of the year due to a suspension stemming from a late-2021 dustup.

5. Atlanta Braves

Record: 5-7

Last Week: 2

A little bit of panic for the reigning World Series champions, who began the year as the No. 1 team in these rankings and are now barely clinging to a top-five spot. The bottom-third of the lineup is badly struggling, most notably Dansby Swanson. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts in Monday night’s loss to the Dodgers and is 6-for-42 (.141) with 20 whiffs through 12 games to begin the year. The good news is that Ronald Acuña (knee) appears set to begin a rehab assignment on Tuesday.

6. Houston Astros

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 6

Yordan Alvarez returned Monday from a week-long absence due to illness and sure looked to be back at peak health, going 3-for-5 with a pair of 420-foot home runs and a fourth-inning single that came off his bat 109.6 mph. His four-RBI night helped the Astros to a decisive 8-3 win over the division-rival Angels. The 24-year-old masher is sporting a 1.153 OPS through his first 22 plate appearances this season. For his career, he’s averaging 42 homers and 129 RBI in every 162 games played.

7. Milwaukee Brewers

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 7

Christian Yelich hit his first home run of the year, a fourth-inning grand slam, as the Brewers cruised to a 6-1 victory against the Pirates on Monday in Milwaukee. Including his results from the Cactus League this spring, it was the first time that Yelich had gone deep since September 24, 2021. Eric Lauer got the start on Monday, working six innings of one-run ball, and now Pittsburgh will have to contend with Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff in the final two games of the three-game set.

8. New York Yankees

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 9

It came in a late 5-0 loss to the Orioles, but Nestor Cortes struck out 12 batters over five scoreless innings on Sunday, becoming the first pitcher in Yankees franchise history to record 12-plus strikeouts in five frames or fewer. Including his strong season debut on April 12 against a dangerous Blue Jays team, the 27-year-old left-hander holds a 0.00 ERA and 17/1 K/BB ratio in 9 1/3 innings to begin the 2022 campaign. He’s lined up for a showdown versus the visiting Guardians this Saturday.

9. Tampa Bay Rays

Record: 5-6

Last Week: 8

Wander Franco was scratched from the Rays’ lineup on Monday at Wrigley Field, though manager Kevin Cash did tell reporters after the game -- a 4-2 loss for Tampa Bay -- that his star shortstop could be ready to return as early as Tuesday. Injuries have already wreaked havoc on the pitching side of the depth chart, with Shane Baz, Luis Patino, Tyler Glasnow, Yonny Chirinos, Brendan McKay, Nick Anderson, and Pete Fairbanks currently on the 60-day IL. Ryan Yarbrough is on the 10-day IL.

10. San Francisco Giants

Record: 7-2

Last Week: 14

The reigning NL West champs are on a five-game winning streak after their weekend sweep at Cleveland. San Francisco’s pitching staff currently holds the lowest combined ERA in the majors at 2.20. And has Brandon Belt’s late-career surge drawn enough praise? The veteran first baseman struck a two-run homer in Sunday’s rout of the Guardians and carries a .996 OPS (169 OPS+) with 41 home runs and 96 RBI in 155 games since the beginning of the delayed and condensed 2020 season.

11. San Diego Padres

Record: 7-5

Last Week: 12

Sean Manaea tossed six innings of one-run ball and Manny Machado slugged his second home run of the year as the Padres sailed to a 4-1 win over the visiting Reds on Monday night at Petco Park. Taylor Rogers, an Opening Day addition from the Twins, closed that one out for his NL-leading fifth save. And here’s a fun note: San Diego is the first team in MLB history to go 12 games without an error to begin a season. Sharp all-around play has put the Friars in solid position here in mid-April.

12. Philadelphia Phillies

Record: 4-7

Last Week: 10

Philly has lost six of its last seven games versus the Mets, Marlins, and Rockies. And there is heightened concern around Bryce Harper, who is currently limited to DH duties because of tendinitis in his right (throwing) elbow. “Get treatment on it and try to get through it,” the 29-year-old outfielder said of the ailment on Monday. “I’ve never had arm problems in my life, so this is very new to me. Just trying to feel it out and see what happens.” That certainly seems like something to monitor.

13. Boston Red Sox

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 11

Patriots’ Day is supposed to be a celebratory event in New England. The improving weather, the Boston Marathon, the early start time at Fenway Park. But the 2022 edition of that regional holiday will not be remembered so fondly after the Red Sox fell 8-3 to the visiting Twins. Rich Hill got the start on Monday and gave up four earned runs over 4 2/3 innings while watching his early-season ERA rise to 7.00. He’s looking every bit of 42 years old for a team that needs reliable pitching production.

14. St. Louis Cardinals

Record: 5-3

Last Week: 15

After taking three of four from the Pirates and Royals to open the season, the Cardinals then split a four-game weekend series with the reigning NL Central-champion Brewers. Albert Pujols ripped his second home run of the year, and the 681st home run of his career, in Sunday’s loss at American Family Field. It left his bat at 109.9 mph and traveled 426 feet. He’s now just 19 big flies away from joining Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, and Babe Ruth as the fourth member of the 700 home run club.

15. Seattle Mariners

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 13

They won two of three versus the division-rival Astros over the weekend, but the Mariners are .500 through 10 games. It’s not the most ideal start for an organization that is aiming to end a 20-year postseason drought, the longest such drought in North American sports. Julio Rodriguez is 4-for-32 (.125) with only one extra-base hit through his first nine major league games. And while Jarred Kelenic did homer last week against the White Sox, his batting line currently sits at .172/.242/.310.

16. Los Angeles Angels

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 16

Anaheim had won five of its last six games before falling 8-3 to the reigning AL West-champion Astros on Monday night in Houston. Mike Trout was missing from action in that one after taking a pitch off the top of his left hand on Sunday afternoon in Arlington. The good news is that X-rays and an MRI both came back negative for any structural damage. Word from Angels head athletic trainer Mike Frostad is that Trout will have to determine his own readiness for a return based on pain tolerance.

17. Minnesota Twins

Record: 4-6

Last Week: 17

Byron Buxton sadly -- predictably? -- tweaked something in his right knee while sliding into second base last Friday against the Red Sox. But the star outfielder has yet to be placed on the injured list, and Twins manager Rocco Baldelli expressed optimism on Monday that Buxton would be able to return to action sometime later this week. The same can’t be said for Alex Kirilloff, who landed on the IL last Wednesday due to a recurrence of wrist discomfort that dates all the way back to 2019.

18. Detroit Tigers

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 18

The growing expectations for the Tigers may have to be put on hold, as they were forced to place Javier Baez on the injured list over the weekend due to lingering soreness in his right thumb and will be without former No. 1 overall pick Casey Mize for an extended period after he was diagnosed with a medial collateral ligament sprain in his right elbow. There’s also some concern about Matt Manning, who left his start Sunday afternoon against the Royals because of shoulder discomfort.

19. Cleveland Guardians

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 19

Jose Ramirez was named American League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, claiming the honor for the fifth time in his illustrious 10-year major league career. The star third baseman agreed to a five-year, $124 million contract extension with Cleveland a just few days before Opening Day and has been red-hot out of the gate here in 2022, boasting a .457/.500/.886 batting line with eight extra-base hits (three homers, four doubles, one triple) and 15 RBI through nine games played.

20. Chicago Cubs

Record: 6-4

Last Week: 21

Seiya Suzuki was named National League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, becoming only the eighth Japanese-born player to earn that honor. He then went 2-for-3 with two runs scored in the Cubs’ 4-2 defeat of the Rays on Monday night at Wrigley Field, growing his overall batting line to .429/.564/.929 through 39 plate appearances. He is the first Cubs player to hit safely in his first 10 major league games since Andy Pafko in 1943. We’ll say it: Suzuki is your 2021 NL Rookie of the Year.

21. Colorado Rockies

Record: 7-3

Last Week: 25

A relatively sparking 7-3 record through 10 games for the Rockies. They took two of three from the Dodgers to begin the season, swept a two-game set from the Rangers, split four with the Cubs over the weekend, and then shut down the Phillies for a 4-1 win on Monday night at Coors Field. C.J. Cron has a 1.129 OPS with five home runs and 10 RBI through 43 plate appearances. Connor Joe, who has seemingly taken over the leadoff role, is currently slashing .359/.468/.641.

22. Kansas City Royals

Record: 3-5

Last Week: 20

Major League Baseball is hard. Just ask Bobby Witt Jr., who was widely regarded as the No. 1 overall prospect in the sport after batting .290/.361/.576 with 33 homers and 29 steals over 124 games last summer in the minors. Witt tore up the Cactus League this spring and claimed a spot on the Opening Day roster in Kansas City, but he’s showing a weak .156/.182/.281 slash line through his first 33 plate appearances at the MLB level. He has struck out 11 times while drawing only one walk.

23. Miami Marlins

Record: 4-5

Last Week: 23

After winning only one of five games against the Giants and Angels to begin the 2022 campaign, the Marlins rallied to take three of four from the division-rival Phillies over the weekend. In a lopsided 11-3 victory on Sunday afternoon, Jazz Chisholm tallied an RBI triple in the bottom of the second, an RBI double in the bottom of the sixth, and a run-scoring sac fly in the bottom of the seventh. The dynamic 24-year-old has already driven home 10 runs in just seven games played.

24. Oakland Athletics

Record: 6-5

Last Week: 28

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 news cycle has yet to fully let up. Oakland got hit hard on Monday, having to place Austin Allen, Jed Lowrie, Chad Pinder, A.J. Puk, Kirby Snead, and Lou Trivino on the IL due to either positive tests, contact tracing, COVID-like symptoms, or some variety of the three. And yet the Athletics went out and earned a 5-1 win in their home opener against the Orioles and are a game above the .500 mark as the second full week of the 2022 season gets underway.

25. Arizona Diamondbacks

Record: 3-6

Last Week: 26

As a group right now, the Diamondbacks have a combined .152/.284/.264 slash line through 330 plate appearances. Seth Beer is the only Arizona hitter with a batting average above .212 and an OPS north of .704. Pull out Beer’s contributions and the collective line for the D-backs falls to .133/.272/.239 in 307 plate appearances. The rotation and its 3.03 ERA has been severely mistreated. They’re only moving up a spot in this week’s rankings because the Rangers so richly deserved to drop.

26. Texas Rangers

Record: 2-7

Last Week: 22

Not that the offense has been humming -- Marcus Semien is off to an especially discouraging start -- but it’s the pitching staff that is going to hold this team back from any semblance of contention after that big wintertime spending spree. As of Tuesday afternoon, Rangers starters and relievers have combined for a 6.19 ERA, by far the worst mark of any MLB team. Jon Gray (blister) is set to return from the injured list Tuesday at Seattle, but he’s doubtful to be the hero that Texas badly needs.

27. Washington Nationals

Record: 4-7

Last Week: 27

This is shaping up to be a very rough season for the Nationals, who just dropped three of four to the lowly Pirates. But, hey, they do still have Juan Soto. The 23-year-old slugger had a solo home run, a double, and two walks on Saturday in Pittsburgh and has now reached base at least four times in 54 different games over the course of his young career. The most games reaching base safely four-plus times before age 24 … Ted Williams: 76, Buddy Lewis: 55, Juan Soto: 54, Mel Ott: 53.

28. Cincinnati Reds

Record: 2-9

Last Week: 24

After getting dismantled by the Dodgers over the weekend in Los Angeles and falling 4-1 to the Padres on Monday night in San Diego, the Reds sit at the very bottom of the team OPS leaderboard with a mark of just .541. It doesn’t help that 2021 NL Rookie of the Year Award winner Jonathan India hasn’t played since last Thursday -- and apparently won’t be ready to return before this Friday -- because of a right hamstring issue. Hunter Greene is fun; Cincinnati’s offense currently is not.

29. Pittsburgh Pirates

Record: 5-5

Last Week: 29

Diego Castillo provided the only run of the night for the Pirates in their loss Monday against the Brewers, belting an opposite-field solo shot in the top of the fourth inning. The 24-year-old infielder also stroked a single in the top of the sixth and has raced out to a .310 batting average across his first 29 plate appearances as a big leaguer. Castillo has been handling second base for the Bucs with Ke’Bryan Hayes locked in long term at third. Now let’s bring on top shortstop prospect Oneil Cruz.

30. Baltimore Orioles

Record: 3-7

Last Week: 30

O’s fans -- and fantasy managers -- are mostly awaiting the arrival of Adley Rutschman, who could have maybe cracked the Opening Day roster in Baltimore had he not suffered a strained right triceps muscle at the very start of camp this spring. There is good news on that front, though, as general manager Mike Elias said on the MASN broadcast over the weekend that the 24-year-old top prospect should begin catching in minor league games “very soon.” Circle mid-May for his MLB debut.

"Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

The indictment doesn’t mention the links to the Georgia government, information USA TODAY, the Savannah Morning News and the Augusta Chronicle pieced together from public records and a review of social media posts.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

Photo included in the Operation Blooming Onion ongoing criminal case as an exhibit. The partial address provided matches one reported as a guest farmworker housing location.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

A home where Brett Bussey lived in Tifton, Ga.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

"Ron Johnson’s approval ratings are underwater in a swing state that President Joe Biden won.

Instead of moving to the center, though, as he faces reelection this fall, the Wisconsin senator has become the face of conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the 2020 election in the Senate. He has said that gargling mouthwash can kill the coronavirus, Jan. 6 was a mostly “peaceful protest,” and unvaccinated people around the world are being sent “basically into internment camps.”

For a vulnerable senator staring down a tough campaign, the string of head-turning remarks seem to defy political logic. But it turns out that Johnson’s shoot-from-the-lip style is a feature, not a bug, of his campaign for a third term. GOP strategists and officials say his unfiltered remarks are generating enthusiasm among a party base conditioned by Donald Trump, and appealing to independents who loathe Washington.

“He’s still perceived as an outsider. He’s not part of the GOP establishment in D.C., he never has been, and Wisconsinites like that,” said Bill McCoshen, a Wisconsin-based Republican strategist, who is not working on the race. “They may not agree with what he says every time, but they like the fact that he’s willing to speak his mind, and he’s not politically correct.”



Even Democrats largely aren’t campaigning this year against the controversial comments Johnson has made, instead focusing on the senator’s alleged self-dealing in Washington in an attempt to strip him of the non-politician veneer that helped him win past elections.

“Kellyanne Conway was right when she said voters vote on what affects them, not what offends them,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “But nobody likes being ripped off by someone who's out to serve themselves. And that's the core of our message.”

Despite Johnson’s hard turn to the right, this closely watched contest that could determine party control of the Senate is a coin flip, according to both Democratic and GOP consultants — a reflection of the fact that Republicans across the country face an extremely favorable political environment.

Story continues

Yet at the same time that he has served up red meat for the base, he’s also hedged his bets by presenting a softer side in TV ads in past elections. Johnson is replicating that playbook in this year’s midterm election.

He has run spots this campaign that highlight the Joseph Project, a program Johnson co-founded with the late African American Pastor Jerome Smith Sr., to help people in Milwaukee find jobs. One features Smith’s widow, Markeitha Smith, who attests, “I never would have thought that Ron Johnson would have ever been somebody who I can say is family. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, he actually came here.’”



In his successful bid in 2016, Johnson aired similar commercials on the initiative. His other positive spots this year are emotional testimonials from people who said his “Right to Try” legislation — which allows those with life-threatening diseases or conditions to try experimental drugs — saved their or their loved ones’ lives.

“It shows a more sensitive side to somebody who’s been working out in Washington, D.C. for the last 12 years,” said Brandon Scholz, former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party. “Instead, somebody’s on the local news talking about helping people and jobs in a place you wouldn’t expect to see Ron Johnson, in center city Milwaukee.”

A Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who worked on the 2016 Senate race, in which Johnson defeated former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, said Johnson has won in the past because he excited GOP diehards on right-wing radio while also appealing to white suburban women with his TV ads.

“Ron Johnson has been consistently underestimated as a candidate,” the person said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. “He has figured out how to be different people to different audiences.”

In regards to his comments about Covid-19, Johnson has said previously that he did not mean that mouthwash should be an alternative to the vaccine, and his office pointed to an Australian quarantine site when asked about his internment camp remarks. Speaking about the Capitol riot, while he downplayed the events of Jan. 6, he condemned the violence that day.

The case that Johnson can win reelection this year rests in part on a standout number — he outperformed Trump in 2016 by 74,000 votes, including in Milwaukee and Dane counties, where Madison is located, as well as in suburban Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, or “WOW,” counties, reliably GOP areas where Trump experienced some slippage in 2020.

Republicans are also counting on Johnson to benefit from voters turning against Democrats nationally. In Wisconsin, 52 percent of voters disapprove of Biden's performance, while 43 percent approve, according to a Marquette Law School poll in February.

GOP strategists said Johnson has shown the ability to unify the MAGA base and more old-school Republicans in the suburbs, while also picking up anti-establishment independents. In Wisconsin, they said, many swing voters are not traditional moderates, but instead are more defined by their loathing of Washington and the state capitol.

In commercials in his previous campaigns, Johnson leaned into being the only manufacturer in a sea of lawyers in the Senate.

“Ron Johnson is truly his own man. He could say anything tomorrow, and you could call me and I’d say, ‘I had no idea he was going to say that,’” said a person close to Johnson. “That’s full of risk and that’s full of hand-wringing by the establishment Republicans and it’s full of alarm-ringing by the media. And it’s also full of authenticity with voters, including swing voters, not just the base.”



At the same time that Trump lost his second bid in Wisconsin, Republican congressional candidates in total also outperformed the then-president by more than 50,000 votes — evidence of the willingness of some conservative and swing voters to cast their ballots for those in the GOP not named Trump.

Still, Democrats view the race as a top opportunity to pick up a Republican-held seat. After nearly a dozen years in the Senate, they think they can pierce Johnson’s image as an outsider businessman. In fact, they think it’s already been popped: Johnson is viewed unfavorably by 45 percent of voters, compared to 33 percent who see him favorably, according to the recent Marquette poll. Twenty-one percent said they hadn’t heard enough about Johnson or didn’t know.

“I think it is entirely possible that Democrats have a bad night nationally, and Ron Johnson still loses,” said Joe Zepecki, a Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who is not working for any Senate candidate. “That's how much trouble I really genuinely believe that he's in here.”

Democrats have seized on a plan to paint Johnson as self-serving for pushing for a provision in Trump’s tax bill that benefited his own company and campaign donors. In 2017, Johnson held his vote for the legislation until he secured a bigger tax cut for “pass-through” entities, arguing that small businesses would be undercut at the expense of corporations otherwise.

Opportunity Wisconsin, an anti-Johnson group, has aired more than $3 million of negative ads hitting him for “passing tax laws that benefit himself.” And Democrats think he recently put his foot in his mouth in a way that makes their case for them. At a meeting with GOP activists this month, Johnson was asked how to fight back against attacks about the tax bill.

“Now, did my business benefit? Sure,” Johnson said. “Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits.”

Jake Wilkins, a spokesperson for Johnson, defended his advocacy for the tax legislation as “single-handedly keeping small businesses competitive with the big guys by insisting on tax cuts for everyone.”

Wilkins also touted the senator’s work on the Joseph Project and Right to Try: “Based on what he has accomplished, Senator Johnson believes he is in a strong position to win reelection. His strategy will be to do what he has consistently done: work hard and simply tell the truth.”

Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin native and anti-Trump ex-Republican, previously supported Johnson but now compares him to Joseph McCarthy, the former Wisconsin senator who led a demagogic red-baiting campaign.

“Johnson should be the most vulnerable Republican in the country,” he said. But given the political mood, the race “leans Republican, even as unpopular as Johnson is, unless the Democrats can really get their act together.”",Holly Otterbein,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-johnson-pursues-scorched-earth-083000728.html,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,Yahoo
"A spring nor'easter has already dropped at least a foot of snow on parts of New York and Pennsylvania, leading to power outages and the closure of businesses and schools.

More than 240,000 customers were without power in the Northeast Tuesday morning. New York had the most outages at more than 160,000, while Pennsylvania had more than 50,000, according to PowerOutage.us.

Virgil, in upstate New York, had seen the most snowfall by Tuesday afternoon, with 18 inches on the ground.

Indian Lake, New York, and New Milford, Pennsylvania, were each buried in 16 inches of snow.

Broome County, New York, implemented a travel ban. Binghamton, which is within Broome, got 14.2 inches of snow, setting the record for their biggest April snowstorm.

The heavy, wet snow was falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour across upstate New York.

In Syracuse, the rapid snowfall and outages prompted numerous school and business closures.

Forecasters said the snow is expected to taper through the day, but not before dropping 3 to 6 more inches. The highest totals will be in the Adirondack Mountains.

High winds will stay in place through the night, long after the snow stops.

Nantucket, Massachusetts, will likely see wind gusts of 43 mph, while Islip, on New York's Long Island, will see 39 mph gusts.

An ""abnormally chilly air-mass"" in the east will remain through the middle of the week, according to the National Weather Service.

""A handful of daily record cold high and low temperatures are forecast in parts of the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast today,"" the weather service said.

About 40 million people were under frost and freeze alerts Tuesday morning stretching from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic.

Temperatures 15 to 25 degrees below average will make highs Tuesday and Wednesday feel more like March than April.

The region will get a chance to thaw out later in the week when a warmup is expected.","Elisha Fieldstadt, Kathryn Prociv",https://news.yahoo.com/april-noreaster-drops-foot-snow-130320026.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/FW_L6qfcqvnHSxtnHknoNQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/Hv6pSbzikwTZ0FEW8xdOSQ--~B/aD0yNjg4O3c9NDAzMjthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_news_122/0028957c7e1b8df26a01e3b1dd9dd9c5,Yahoo
"A group of President Donald Trump’s allies and associates spent months trying to overturn the 2020 election based on his lie that he was the true winner.

Now, some of the same confidants who tried and failed to invalidate the results based on a set of bogus legal theories are pushing an even wilder sequel: that by “decertifying” the 2020 vote in key states, the outcome can still be reversed.

In statehouses and courtrooms across the country, as well as on right-wing news outlets, allies of Trump — including lawyer John Eastman — are pressing for states to pass resolutions rescinding Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden and to bring lawsuits that seek to prove baseless claims of large-scale voter fraud. Some of those allies are casting their work as a precursor to reinstating the former president.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

The efforts have failed to change any statewide outcomes or uncover mass election fraud. Legal experts dismiss them as preposterous, noting that there is no plausible scenario under the Constitution for returning Trump to office.

But just as Eastman’s original plan to use Congress’ final count of electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the election was seen as far-fetched in the run-up to the deadly Capitol riot, the continued efforts are fueling a false narrative that has resonated with Trump’s supporters and stoked their grievances. They are keeping alive the same combustible stew of conspiracy theory and misinformation that threatens to undermine faith in democracy by nurturing the lie that the election was corrupt.

The efforts have fed a cottage industry of podcasts and television appearances centered around not only false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020, but the notion that the results can still be altered after the fact — and Trump returned to power, an idea that he continues to push privately as he looks toward a probable reelection run in 2024.

Story continues

Democrats and some Republicans have raised deep concerns about the impact of the decertification efforts. They warn of unintended consequences, including the potential to incite violence of the sort that erupted on Jan. 6, when a mob of Trump’s supporters — convinced that he could still be declared the winner of the 2020 election — stormed the Capitol. Legal experts worry that the focus on decertifying the last election could pave the way for more aggressive — and earlier — legislative intervention the next time around.

“At the moment, there is no other way to say it: This is the clearest and most present danger to our democracy,” said J. Michael Luttig, a leading conservative lawyer and former appeals court judge, for whom Eastman clerked and whom President George W. Bush considered as a nominee to be the chief justice of the United States. “Trump and his supporters in Congress and in the states are preparing now to lay the groundwork to overturn the election in 2024 were Trump, or his designee, to lose the vote for the presidency.”

Most of Trump’s aides would like him to stop talking about 2020 — or, if he must, to focus on changes to voting laws across the country rather than his own fate. But like he did in 2020 when many officials declined to help him upend the election results, Trump has found a group of outside allies willing to take up an outlandish argument they know he wants to see made.

The efforts have been led or loudly championed by Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow; Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser; Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist; and Boris Epshteyn, an aide and associate of Trump’s.

Another key player has been Eastman, the right-wing lawyer who persuaded Trump shortly after the election that Vice President Mike Pence could reject certified electoral votes for Biden when he presided over the congressional count and declare Trump the victor instead.

Eastman wrote a memo and Epshteyn sent an email late last year to the main legislator pushing a decertification bill in Wisconsin, laying out a legal theory to justify the action. Eastman met last month with Robin Vos, the speaker of the state Assembly, and activists working across the country, a meeting that was reported earlier by The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Jefferson Davis, an activist from Wisconsin, said he had asked Eastman to join the meeting after hearing about his work on behalf of Trump following the election.

“If it was good enough for the president of the United States,” Davis said in an interview, “then his expertise was good enough to meet with Speaker Vos in Wisconsin on election fraud and what do we do to fix it.”

Vos has maintained that the Legislature has no pathway to decertification, in line with the guidance of its own lawyers.

“There is no mechanism in state or federal law for the Legislature to reverse certified votes cast by the Electoral College and counted by Congress,” the lawyers wrote, adding that impeachment was the only way to remove a sitting president other than in the case of incapacity.

But Eastman has made clear that he has no intention of dropping his fight to prove that the election was stolen. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack has said his legal efforts to invalidate the results most likely violated the law by trying to defraud the American people. A federal judge recently agreed, calling Eastman’s actions “a coup in search of a legal theory.”

Legal experts say his continued efforts could increase his criminal exposure; but if Eastman were ever to be charged with fraud, he could also point to his recent work as evidence that he truly believed the election was stolen.

“There are a lot of things still percolating,” Eastman said in an interview with The New York Times last fall. He claimed that states had illegally given people the ability to cast votes in ways that should have been forbidden, corrupting the results. And he pointed to a widely debunked video from State Farm Arena in Atlanta, which he claimed showed that tabulation ballots were run through counting machines multiple times during the election.

Charles Burnham, Eastman’s lawyer, said in a statement that he “was recently invited to lend his expertise to legislators and citizens in Wisconsin confronting significant evidence of election fraud and illegality. He did so in his role as a constitutional scholar and not on behalf of any client.”

The fringe legal theory that Eastman and Epshteyn are promoting — which has been widely dismissed — holds that state lawmakers have the power to choose how electors are selected, and they can change them long after the Electoral College has certified votes if they find fraud and illegality sufficiently altered the outcome. The theory has surfaced in multiple states, including several that are political battlegrounds.

As in Wisconsin, state legislators in Arizona drafted resolutions calling for the decertification of the 2020 election. In Georgia, a lawsuit sought to decertify the victories of the Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. And Robert Regan, a Republican favored to win a seat in the Michigan House, has said he wants to decertify the 2020 election either through a ballot petition or the courts.

Bannon, Lindell and Epshteyn have repeatedly promoted decertification at the state level on Bannon’s podcast, “War Room,” since last summer, pushing it as a steady drumbeat and at times claiming that it could lead to Trump being put back into office. They have described the so-called audit movement that began in Arizona and spread to other states as part of a larger effort to decertify electoral votes.

“We are on a full, full freight train to decertify,” Epshteyn said on the program in January. “That’s what we’re going to get. Everyone knows. Everyone knows this election was stolen.”

Last fall, 186 state legislators from 39 states joined a letter written by Wendy Rogers, a Republican state senator from Arizona who has appeared at events hosted by Lindell, calling on “each state to decertify its electors where it has been shown the elections were certified prematurely and inaccurately.”

All the efforts have either failed to progress or been rejected for lack of legal grounds in the absence of any evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have affected the 2020 election. And even as elected Republicans have almost uniformly embraced Trump’s claims that the vote was stolen, many have rejected the idea that states should decertify their results or argued that the effort was merely symbolic, noting that he could never be reinstated.

Still, Trump is now the front-runner in public opinion surveys of the possible Republican presidential field. While he has yet to declare his candidacy, he has privately told associates that he is planning to run again.

A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The legal drive to reverse his 2020 loss has had ripple effects in the Republican Party. With midterm congressional elections less than six months away, the push has put pressure on candidates to either endorse it or risk the wrath of Trump and his supporters. In Alabama, Rep. Mo Brooks said that the former president had repeatedly demanded that he “rescind” the election and remove Biden. When the congressman said that was impossible, Trump withdrew his endorsement in the state’s Senate Republican primary.

In Pennsylvania, Jake Corman, the top Republican in the state Senate who promised last year to review the 2020 election results, said he had dropped plans to end his bid for governor after Trump urged him to “keep fighting.” He then went on Bannon’s podcast, where Corman said there was “no question” about the need to investigate whether electors needed to be decertified in battleground states, and pledged to “turn the Department of State upside down” to find evidence of illegality.

Last year, Lindell vocally championed the false claim that Biden’s victory could somehow be overturned. In Lindell’s telling, Trump would have been back in office by last August. The former president began telling associates the same thing, privately urging supporters to echo it and pressing conservative writers to state it.

August came and went with no return by Trump, but that did little to quash the idea. Flynn, who recently met with Trump at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, according to people close to the former president, posted messages on the social media platform Telegram calling for decertification of the results in Wisconsin.

But even among Trump’s staunchest backers, there is a divide over the decertification efforts, with some calling them a waste of energy.

Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official, pointed out at a recent event with conservative activists in Pennsylvania that the idea of Trump being reinstated as president was not realistic.

“We’re not going to overturn the election in 2020,” Roman told the attendees. “We’re just not.”

"Avert your eyes, Blue Oval fans. There's one fewer Ford Bronco on the road today than there was last week. And that's because the Bronco we're focusing on today is in the water, not on land. The photos you see here were taken by Kip Wing of Aerial Aesthetic in Maine, near Bar Harbor. The driver of a Bronco was reportedly attempting to drive in the sand at low tide between the coast and Bar Island when they got stuck and couldn't get out ahead of the rising tide.

The result? One sunken Ford Bronco. Fortunately, reports indicate the Bronco's occupant(s) got out safely.

According to a few sources cited by The Drive, locals say the driver of the Bronco was doing donuts in the sand, which goes a long way toward explaining how they got stuck in the first place. As you can see in the video above, a pair of pickup trucks tried to free the SUV from its sandy grave using tow straps, but gave that up when one of them snapped.

The Bronco has since been floated using buoyancy bags that a diver attached to the vehicle from underneath. Island Towing then attached ropes and pulled the Bronco into an area that was accessed with a wrecker, and the Bronco was back to dry land.",Jeremy Korzeniewski,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/04/18/ford-bronco-sunk-bar-harbor-maine/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2022/04/18141736/ford-bronco-sunk-bar-harbor.jpeg,Yahoo

The Ford Bronco is one of the most capable and desirable off-roaders on sale today. As such, we’ve all gotten to watch videos of these SUVs pulling off some incredible feats on the trails. That said, one Bronco driver out in Bar Harbor, Maine, learned the limits of their new 4x4 the hard way when it became lodged on a sandbar over the weekend. Unfortunately for them, that ill-advised parking spot has turned into a truck drowning site in several feet of deep Atlantic water.

🚘 Don’t miss any amazing stories. Join our team.

According to WDEA, the Bronco became stuck on the sandbar this past Saturday afternoon. The driver was reportedly doing donuts with the 4x4 before becoming unable to get free. While simply getting stuck on a beach might not always be the worst-case scenario, this particular owner seems to have missed the nearby warning signs that point out the dangerously high tides in the area. Perhaps that lack of local knowledge can be explained by the truck’s New Jersey plates. Either way, things became very expensive shortly thereafter.



Regardless of how it was placed there, the Bronco could not be extricated before the deeper water returned from the sea. The incoming tides drowned the 4x4 up to the base of its windshield, which must have been an awful sight for the owner. The Bronco might be able to survive fording through 33.5-inches of water, but there isn’t a chance it will survive this ordeal. Attempts were once again made to rescue the SUV on Easter morning, though you can watch how that ended in the video.

It can be hard not to feel invincible when you’re behind the wheel of something like the Bronco. With the capability on offer from a modern 4x4, it isn’t hard for an inexperienced owner to get a bit overconfident. Hopefully the owner of this particular Bronco doesn’t have to wait terribly long for a replacement.

"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

It's tempting for Americans to get smug about the sinking of the Moskva, the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea. Whether it was destroyed by Ukrainians or — less plausibly — sunk because of a non-combat onboard explosion of ammunition, the result is both a humiliation and a setback for Vladimir Putin's war efforts. If you're cheering Ukraine's defenders, it's hard not to take some satisfaction in that.

But America's fleet might also be more vulnerable than you think.

For several years now, going back to a pair of collisions separately involving the U.S.S. John S. McCain and U.S.S. Fitzgerald in 2017, there have been a series of reports indicating that the U.S. Navy is overstretched, overworked, and under-maintained, and thus increasingly vulnerable as it goes about the expensive task of patrolling the world's oceans.

A February report by the Government Accountability Office broke down the ugly details of how Navy personnel are struggling to keep their ships running properly. ""Some crewmembers provided examples of parts such as electrical safety equipment being on backorder for up to 2 years and described difficulties locating consumable materials such as filters, specific types of oil, and protective clothing for themselves,"" the GAO reported. ""Ten of the 16 ships' crews we met with stated that they resorted to cannibalizing parts — that is, taking functional parts away from other ships, in turn leaving them less-than-operational — so their respective ships could remain operational.""

America might have what is regarded as the most powerful navy in the world — China has the largest, but many of its ships are smaller — but it is clearly fragile. And that's a problem.

""The U.S. Navy is on the verge of strategic bankruptcy,"" Christopher Dougherty, a former assistant defense secretary, wrote last year. ""Its fleet isn't large enough to meet global day-to-day demands for naval forces. Due to repeated deployments and maintenance backlogs, the fleet also isn't ready enough to meet these demands safely, nor can it quickly surge in an emergency."" He concluded that ""the risk of its debts coming due suddenly (and perhaps violently) will increase.""

Story continues

Even without those challenges, there is also the question of whether the U.S. Navy is built for the modern world.

Just as aircraft carriers once replaced battleships as the backbone of the fleet, there are now questions about whether America's carrier-based fleet is overly vulnerable to a new generation of Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles. And those questions are likely to get more pertinent if it turns out the Ukrainians really did take out the Moskva with their new Neptune missile.

America has spent much of the 21st century learning that the overwhelming power of its armed forces isn't always so overwhelming. The sinking of the Moskva is a sign that such a lesson might also extend to the U.S. Navy. Finding out the hard way might be disastrous.

"NASA

Forget Mars—Jupiter’s moon Europa is one of the most promising worlds in the solar system to look for alien life, in large part because it boasts a huge liquid ocean sitting below a sheet of ice. Although Europa is just one-fourth the diameter of Earth, its ocean may have twice as much water as our planet’s oceans combined. And where there is water, there is the chance for life as we know it to settle down.

But actually discovering whatever alien life might live on Europa will be an extremely tough challenge. The moon’s icy shell is thought to be 10 to 15 miles thick. The furthest humans have ever dug into Earth is 7.67 miles.

However, it might not be as daunting as we think. A new study published in Nature Communications on Tuesday reveals that the icy shell itself might be much more porous than previously thought. In fact, the ice might be home to multiple pockets of water that could support life as well.

Why NASA is Obsessed With Europa, Jupiter’s Watery Moon

The key to these new findings? Greenland. New data collected with ice-penetrating radar shows the formation of “double ridge” features in the Greenland ice sheet—features that are present on Europa as well. The researchers behind the new paper believe that the mechanism for how these double ridges formed in Greenland ought to apply to Europa—which suggests that there is more liquid water on the Jovian moon than we could ever have imagined.

“It was really a bit of serendipity,” Riley Culberg, an electrical engineer pursuing a PhD at Stanford University who led the new study, told The Daily Beast. “One of my colleagues on this paper, who is a planetary scientist, was giving a presentation on the big open questions in Europa science and showed a picture of these double ridges on the surface. It struck me that I had seen a similar looking feature in my own data from Earth while working on a totally different project related to climate change impacts on the Greenland ice sheet.”

Story continues

Culberg and his colleagues went back to the Europa data, and found that double ridges on the Jovian moon (first observed in the 1990s by NASA’s Galileo mission) exhibit a peculiar kind of ratio between the height of the ridges and the distance between the two peaks. After accounting for the difference in gravity between Earth and Europa, the team realized the Greenland features had a pretty similar ratio as well, which meant the double ridges seemed to form similarly in both places.

Artist’s conception shows how double ridges on the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa may form over shallow, refreezing water pockets within the ice shell. Justice Blaine Wainwright

We know that the double ridges form in Greenland when ice fractures around pockets of pressurized liquid water that was refreezing inside the ice sheet, prompting two peaks to rise in a specific shape. These pockets of water are shallow and help make the ice sheet more porous.

The researchers believe the same mechanism accounts for the double ridges on Europa—meaning the icy shell is dynamic, permeable, and perhaps rife with shallow bodies of liquid water.

“If Europa’s double ridges also form in this way, it suggests that shallow water pockets must have been, or maybe still are, extremely common in the ice shell,” said Culberg. “Double ridges are by far the most common surface that we see in imagery from Europa, so if they form over water, it would really have to be everywhere in the ice shell.” That means the opportunities for life to evolve on the Jovian moon are much more common.

Culberg cautioned that we won’t be able to confirm any of this until we’ve had a chance to actually study Europa directly. That will likely occur in the next decade: NASA is planning to launch an orbiting probe called Europa Clipper in October 2024, and it should arrive on Europa in April 2030. It will be armed with an ice-penetrating radar that will be critical at telling us more about Europa’s icy shell—and should help uncover whether Europa really is our solar system’s best bet for supporting life.

"Even after being hit with price increases from $1,000 to $2,000 last December, the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E continued to be too hot a commodity. By the beginning of March, Ford closed order books for three of the five trims: Premium, California Route 1, and GT Performance. That left the Select and GT on the menu until recently, when Ford took those trims off the shelf and closed up the Mustang Mach-E shop. The model page on Ford's website informs all, ""Due to high demand, the current model year is no longer available for retail order. Limited inventory may be available at selected dealers. Contact your dealer for more information.""

Note, this is only a matter for the U.S. at the moment. Ford's Canadian website still shows four Mach-E trims on offer, omitting only the GT.

CarsDirect reports that the Ford sent a letter to dealers saying the price increases meant to take effect on April 13 have been canceled. That seems obvious when dealing with a product no longer available to order, but the instructions could be for vehicle allocations that end up on dealer lots. Not that a manufacturer price increase would matter, considering the raging markups customers are willing to pay.

Or perhaps postponed is a better word than canceled for the increases. The price bumps were rumored to run from $2,000 to $5,000, with the delivery charge climbing another $100. We figure they'll show up when Ford announces the 2023 Mach-E.

Waiting for order books to open for next year's model, or scouting among the potential ""limited inventories"" on dealer lots will be the only way get a Mach E in the meantime. On paper, the situation next year should improve thanks to Ford's pledge to double battery production and triple Mach-E production. But nothing has returned to any kind of normal in the world, the F-150 Lightning is expected to enter production next week, and even after semiconductors and the supply chain stop misbehaving, the pent-up market demand needs to exhaust itself before we can see what the world might look like on the other side of this chaotic hump.

"Thirty years ago, at 14, I was a child who made a huge mistake. I married my first boyfriend because I was pregnant with his child. I found myself trapped in an abusive relationship with a man who abused pain medication every day, refused to work and only wanted to live off government assistance. I didn’t believe in any of that and vowed to work myself out of that life.

Against all odds, I went to college, got my degree and became a public-school teacher in Florida. I loved working with children in school and spending time with my own children. During this time, my husband became more abusive. Ten years ago, I got the courage to leave the marriage with the hope of building a happy life for myself and my children.

However, during the divorce, I learned a word I had never known — alimony. It never occurred to me that if I left this horrible situation, I would have to continue to work to pay a significant amount of my hard-earned income to a man who refused to work, abused his family and still refuses to even look for work. How could this happen?

Actually, Florida law allows it to happen, and divorce lawyers drain families of all their savings and assets to get as much alimony as possible for their clients, in this case my ex-husband. The inconsistency of outcomes in court encourages costly, lengthy litigation. And, who really wins? Divorce lawyers.

I was forced to pay permanent lifetime alimony to a man who never cared for his children, who lives far away and who has never even tried to sustain himself. I have been paying him for the past 10 years, while I continue to work and better myself. How can the courts say that I have to do this forever, until I die. How is this fair?

I implore Gov. Ron DeSantis to sign the alimony reform legislation — Senate Bill 1796 — into law. The bill proposes reasonable guidelines and makes it harder for divorce lawyers to use children as bargaining chips during divorce proceedings when mothers and fathers are already going through a challenging time.

Story continues

The bill also creates parameters for the already existing “right to retire” for alimony payers like me, which are rarely enforced by the courts. Even trying to modify modifiable alimony agreements is cost-prohibitive thanks to antiquated laws and divorce attorneys’ fees. The governor can help Florida’s families by signing SB 1796 into law, bringing equity, predictability and an opportunity for alimony payers like me to retire with dignity.

"Rattlesnake catchers don’t like surprises, but that’s what happened to Marissa Maki when she started poking around a cactus.

Venomous snakes had been seen in an Arizona family’s yard, and video shows Maki found them in a most unexpected way.

She stuck a pair of tongs deep into a pink cactus and pulled the tool out seconds later with two very excited snakes writhing from the grip.

They were western diamondback rattlesnakes, each one nearly 3 feet long. Maki was surprised, but she kept her head, the video shows.

“I thought I had just one and then I somehow got both the snakes. It was pretty awesome,” Maki told McClatchy News. “I’ve never done that before and I was excited. I wish I could say I planned that, but it was pure accident.”

Video of her “double grab” has been viewed more than 7,200 times since being posted by Maki’s employer, Rattlesnake Solutions, an Arizona-based snake relocation service. Some have called it more “crazy” than cool, given Maki was dodging two sets of fangs at once.

It happened March 23 in the Gold Canyon area southeast of Phoenix. The homeowners had reported seeing rattlesnakes in the front yard, calling Rattlesnake Solutions out of fear the reptiles would eventually encounter their recently acquired puppy.

Western diamondback rattlesnakes live to 20 years and average 3 to 5 feet in Arizona, though some have been known to reach 7 feet, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.

The two snakes Maki caught were happily coiled up at the base of the cactus and clearly annoyed (lots of rattlings) when Maki interrupted their quality time.

They were placed in a bucket together and eventually relocated to a large pack rat nest in the desert, which is standard procedure for Rattlesnake Solutions. The company captured and relocated 1,500 snakes last year and expects to do “slightly more” this year.

"Mayor Sergei Sobyanin detailed an employment plan worth $41 million in an effort to mitigate the dearth in jobs. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images

Moscow's mayor says 200,000 Russians in the city are likely to soon be without work.

Hundreds of Western companies have distanced themselves from Russia, creating a dearth in jobs.

Some global firms pledged to continue paying their local workers, though it's unclear for how long.

Moscow's mayor said on Monday that hundreds of thousands of city residents could lose their jobs as Western companies suspended or pulled their operations from Russia.

""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post.

In the post, Sobyanin said Moscow had approved an employment-support program worth 3.36 billion rubles, or roughly $41 million, that would supply temporary jobs or training to those without work.

Sobyanin wrote that about 58,000 employees were expected to benefit from the program and that Russia would provide a monthly allowance for children and loans for small and medium-size businesses.

Sobyanin's comments came as Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to deny Western sanctions had affected Russia's economy.

""We can now confidently say that such policy (of sanctions) towards Russia has failed,"" he said on Monday. ""The economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work. Moreover, the initiators themselves couldn't get away with the sanctions.""

More than 750 companies have publicly announced that they will cut operations in Russia to some degree since the invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Yale School of Management.

Some companies have pledged to continue paying their Russian workers while they're closed in the country, though it's unclear how long they plan to sustain their support.

McDonald's, one of the first major businesses to withdraw from Russia, said its store closures in the country cost the company $50 million a month because it kept its about 62,000 local workers on the payroll. Some of its locations are still open because the franchisees who own and operate those restaurants have refused to close, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Story continues

Sobyanin's post indicated that Moscow was still grappling with a long list of crises. City authorities will discuss in the next two weeks how the capital will maintain its stock of medicines without imports and how it will keep its hospitality industry afloat, he wrote.

""There is a lot of work to be done, the results of which will appear only in a few years,"" Sobyanin wrote.

"Moscow is poised to lose 200,000 jobs as the Russian economy reels in the face of Western sanctions over Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine, the city's mayor said Tuesday.

Despite Putin's confidence, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin sounded the alarm for the Russian capital on Tuesday.

""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post, according to a translation from Business Insider.

President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders have pointed to evidence of weakness in the Russian economy since the sanctions began. Russia's Ruble had lost almost half of its value by the second week of March, less than a month after Russia's invasion.

Nevertheless, some Western experts say the sanction campaign is not having the desired effect on Russia's economy despite its economy's weakened state.

""We have driven up the price of oil with half measures that have not achieved our objectives,"" Rich Goldberg, an advisory board member at the Vandenberg Coalition and member of the White House National Security Council, told Fox News Digital in March.

"By Joanna Plucinska

WARSAW (Reuters) - Russia will retaliate against Poland if its embassy in Warsaw stops working because it cannot receive fresh funds from Moscow, its ambassador warned on Tuesday.

In March, Poland expelled 45 Russian diplomats over allegations of working for Russian intelligence and blocked the embassy's bank accounts. Moscow, which dismissed the accusations as baseless, retaliated in kind.

""We have some cash reserves, but they are not unlimited and unless the situation changes, after some time it may so happen that we shall not be in a position to pay our bills,"" Sergiy Andreev, 63, told Reuters.

""And it should be clear that as soon as our embassy stops functioning here, the same will happen to the Polish embassy in Moscow,"" he added.

Relations between Russia and Central European countries that once formed part of its sphere of influence have long been fraught but the invasion of Ukraine has fueled fear and suspicion about Moscow's intentions.

Andreev did not specify how soon the embassy may run out of cash, but added that about three-quarters of Russian officials who held diplomatic passports were expelled from Poland.

A spokesperson for Poland's foreign affairs ministry said 45 Polish diplomats were asked to leave Moscow in retaliation and the Polish embassy's bank accounts were frozen.

Andreev said that Poland's stance towards Russia since the Ukraine crisis began on Feb. 24 was particularly hostile, compared to other international partners.

""They are projecting this image of the most unfriendly country towards Russia, in NATO, in the EU, in Europe,"" he said.

Poland's decision to expel the Russian diplomats followed similar decisions in the Baltic states and Bulgaria.

"An Amber Alert has been issued for a 17-year-old girl Arkansas police say has been abducted and being held for ransom after leaving work at a bakery on April 18. The teens’ abductors are demanding $10,000 for her return.

Trynytee Case was last seen leaving work at the Hot Springs bakery, Pour Some Sugar on Me, at around 9:15 p.m. on April 18, police said in the Amber Alert.

Case and a co-worker were walking to their cars after leaving work, and were met by a woman who asked Case if she could use her cellphone, police said.

The stranger told Case and her co-worker that she was lost, and needed to find where her parents were staying in Hot Springs. She asked Case if she could come closer to the unknown woman’s car so she could use her GPS coordinates, according to the Amber Alert, which was issued on April 19.

The co-worker then told Case she was going to get her car in a nearby parking garage, but when she returned, Case was nowhere to be found, the alert said.

After Case’s mother tried to call her multiple times, the 17-year-old answered and said “Everything is fine.” A man then told her mother on the phone that he wants $10,000 for Case’s return, or she will be killed and “cut up,” according to the Amber Alert.

The phone then went dead, and was last pinged headed south of Hot Springs on U.S. highway 7, police said.

"For many people, Our Flag Means Death was an unexpected history lesson about the adventures of Stede Bonnet, the real 18th-century pirate who loved the high seas almost as much as he loathed the “discomforts” of married life with his wife. Our Flag Means Death’s first season often leaned into the absurd as it followed Rhys Darby’s interpretation of Bonnet putting together a crew of vagabonds willing to serve under a soft and inexperienced member of the landed gentry playing a pirate. But what makes the show’s story work — aside from how much of it really does borrow elements from the real Bonnet’s life — is how it’s really only about piracy in the most roundabout sense.

Surprised as many viewers were to learn that the real Stede and Blackbeard did spend a significant amount of time traveling together, what ended throwing many of Our Flag Means Death’s viewers for a loop was the revelation that its Stede and Blackbeard were falling in love. Of all the clever tricks — or fuckery, if you’d prefer — Our Flag Means Death managed to pull off, few were impressive as its ability to disguise the fact that it was a period romance all along, something series creator David Jenkins partially attributes to the expectations we bring to TV. When we spoke with Jenkins recently, he said that while it’s been great watching fans embrace Our Flag Means Death, the surprised responses to its character arcs speak to the importance of using genre fiction to better reflect and play with the realities of our world.

Before we talk about Stede and Ed, let’s talk about David and Taika as showrunner and executive producer.

David Jenkins: For me, the joy of having an EP like Taika is that you know he’s there and is going to come direct the pilot, but then he just leaves me alone, and I get to make the show as weird as I want to make it. We get to take it in the writers room in directions that interest us, and no one’s trying to get in there and fuck with it too much. The great thing about Taika is that he comes back. He does actually direct the pilot — he doesn’t float away — and he decides that it’s well-written enough that he wants to be in it. And then he performs your fucking writing!

There’s moments of improvisation, but like the amount that he’s served those scripts and the amount that he’s served my vision for what the show should be is humbling. When you’re looking at this person who’s incredible and it’s like, “Ah, man. They’re playing my notes. Oh my god, this is incredible.” It’s immensely gratifying.

Is that something one hopes for, but one doesn’t bank on happening?

It’s rare, but I think that’s why he’s a very good producer. I don’t know a ton about his relationship with Sterlin [Harjo] on Reservation Dogs, but that’s Sterlin’s thing. He conceived it with Taika, but Sterlin is the driving force behind that show and what it looks like, and I think part of being a good producer is knowing when to go away and when to come back. Setting people up whose sensibilities you like, and then championing them, and supporting them without trying to control it too much is an amazing skill that I think very few people of his stature have.

What is it about Our Flag Means Death that made it so easy for people to really sort of miss the early queer subtext that’s barely subtext?

I’m the wrong person to ask because I, well, I know a lot more now than I did a month ago, and I know a lot more now than I did two weeks ago based on how this show was going to roll out. I thought it was pretty clear to me that you get halfway through, and you’re like, “Oh, OK. These people have feelings for each other. And they’re attracted to each other.”

Little bit, yeah.

And it’s clear. I think I didn’t realize — because I see myself represented on camera, and I see myself falling in love in stories — I didn’t realize how deep the queer baiting thing goes. Being made to feel stupid by stories, I guess.

How do you mean?

As we were breaking the season and looking at how it would go, part of me knew that, yes, Stede and Ed’s romance was going to be real. But one part of me felt like, “We’re going to do this story, and they’re going to kiss, and maybe that’s not even going to be that big a deal. Maybe it’ll just be a blip.” But then, looking at how people were kind of afraid to let themselves believe that we were doing that was a surprise to me, and it’s heartbreaking.

I understand it much better now, and it’s like, oh, you were made to feel stupid by a bunch of shows — unintentionally, by and large, I think — but made to feel like “maybe I’m going to be up there. Maybe that’ll be me in this story.” And then at the end of it feeling like, “Aw. No, it’s not me. I’m not in this one.” That fucks with you at any age, I think, but especially when you’re young and impressionable. I know it would make me feel that I didn’t belong, and I think that’s part of where the response to the show comes from.

Take me back to when you were first breaking the season and carving out your take on Stede and Ed. What was the key to building out romance between the two of them that felt organic and honest to them both? Not as historical figures but as characters taking shape in your mind?

I’d never written a romance before this one, but I think with Ed and Stede, the question’s always “what’s the need for each other?” I think the need for Stede is pretty apparent in the beginning because he’s just this poor man who doesn’t know at all what he’s doing. Ed, I think, is at a point in his life where he needs to see somebody who’s a bit of an outsider artist who has a fresh take on piracy. Once you figure out what these kinds of characters are missing — what they’re looking for in each other — their stories start to take on their own lives, and they reveal things to you. Like, Stede’s such a great character because he unwittingly seduces this person by being his neat self and doing stuff in a slightly different way.

This is the first time I’ve heard anyone talk about the show through the Stede-as-seducer lens, but you’re totally right. There’s that one line where he asks Blackbeard if he “fancies a fine fabric,” and it killed me because that’s a whole 18th-century pickup line. He’s cruising.

It’s an unintentional seduction, I think, but yeah.

Talk to me about that — the unintentionality of Stede’s seduction and leading with that from a writing perspective.

It’s just that undeniable chemistry between two people falling in love at first sight, essentially. When they see each other, it’s that Beach Boys “Our Prayer” song that our editor Daniel Haworth pitched, and it’s just fantastic in that moment. I don’t know. I love looking at them as having a modern relationship where, you know, maybe you’ve heard about each other before you met, and then you’re kind of into what the other person’s doing, and then it turns out that they’re into what you’re doing. And then you see each other, and there’s chemistry?

But then also, I think there’s something interesting about an amateur going up against the ultimate professional. I’m sure you’ve seen it, too — you’re overworked. But when you see someone who’s writing for fun, and you’re fucking tired and jaded, and you had a bunch of stupid shit happen, but you see that people who’s still feeling it? You remember, “Oh, right. That’s why I do it. This is what I need to get back to. Like, what the fuck? What am I doing?”

Definitely.

I think “do you fancy a fine fabric” is unintentional, but it’s when he tucks the fabric into Blackbeard’s shirt and tells him that he wears fine things well that makes it work. That’s such a kind thing to say and such a perceptive thing for him to say in that moment, and sometimes you meet somebody and you can just see them like that.

You’ve talked in the past about framing Stede as a really naive person with an immature sense of love before meeting Ed because he’d just never really experienced it before. What about Ed’s sense of love and romance, though? He’s this worldly person who’s already exhausted and put upon by his life Pre-Gentleman Pirate.

Yeah, I think they’re both very undeveloped in certain ways, but I think this is Ed’s first time falling in love, too, honestly. He’s more experienced, and he’s, I think, probably more physically experienced than Stede. But they’re these two middle-aged men who are underdeveloped in a certain way in terms of romantic emotional health as we understand it. It made sense to have that love be almost like a teenage version of falling in love — one with all these intense and conflicting feelings. They’re middle-aged, but Stede’s young. Ed’s young. Emotionally, they’re like 16, and they’ve both got a lot to learn.

I want to talk to you about the final episode of the first season and that sort of pointed change that we see both of them go through once that classic misunderstanding has sort of been introduced, right? Stede’s “Crap, I do love him. I have to go get him.” Ed’s like, “He’s left me.” And that sort of feels as if they’ve branched off into two defined states that aren’t just going to be temporary. In that moment when they are sort of not in sync with each other anymore, what do they mean to each other?

I mean, I think it’s two sides of the same coin, which is why we use montage a couple of times at the end of that episode, and why it was important to me that it was scripted that way. Stede’s realizing he’s in love and finding out that he is actually in love is a surprise to him. It didn’t even occur to him that he got it right, and then Mary has to kind of tell him. I think Blackbeard feels like he’s never been rejected in this way before. So in a weird way, Stede’s feeling love — like a more mature version of love than he’s ever felt, and Blackbeard’s feeling a more profound, mature version of rejection. Because he’s never put himself out there like this, and it’s deranging him because he’s a highly emotional person.

There’s so many moments where Izzy’s opposition to Stede can be read as like, “Please stop fucking with my boss. You’re ruining our good thing here,” but that in and of itself also reads as a form of love between Izzy and Ed. As you were building out Izzy’s arc, what were the really important beats that you wanted for him to sort of land on as he keeps sort of being this thorn in the side of this burgeoning romance?

I think the key was casting Con. The part was written before we got him, and then we had a few scripts left to go, and I knew we had Con, and I would actually watch his audition to get back to Izzy’s center. He plays an exhausted quality that’s really lovely because this character could just be generically evil, and the way Con plays, it is like, he’s credible. I believe that he can do some damage if he wanted to. My favorite thing I’ve seen about the show is somebody saying that Con’s playing the only human with a bunch of Muppets. It does feel like that a bit where he’s like Charles Grodin in The Great Muppet Caper.

There’s a lot of Muppet Treasure Island here.

Yeah! And then and then, at the same time, I think Izzy’s deeply in love with Blackbeard, and it’s a very dysfunctional kind of love, and he’s like the jilted spouse who’s losing his man to fucking Stede Bonnet, and he can’t believe this is happening.

So much of this show is about romance, but it’s also like a very clever deconstruction of our ideas about masculinity. What sort of conversations did you have with the other writers about making sure that this was always going to be a show about pirates inhabiting different modes of being as opposed to, you know, Men On the High Seas?

I feel like, particularly over the last five years, we’ve been treated to this burlesque of masculinity.

How do you mean?

Well, it’s meaningless, but you look at people going “look at President [Trump],” and they’re drawing him like a stereotypical macho man, but in actuality, he’s this doughy sack of shit in a suit. You look at Fox News, which is also an interesting burlesque of straight femininity and masculinity, but it’s done through this really distorted, almost pro-wrestling-like lens. It always felt oppressive to me growing up, and now we’ve hit this place where some people are really trying to hang onto these outdated ideas about gender, but society’s actually moving on and past them. I think just to take this very hetero, whitewashed genre and write into it more of what it actually was. There were a lot of pirates who were genderfluid, like Anne Bonny and Mary Read, who were doing the pirate thing before anyone was really talking about women getting into piracy. And then, as we were writing more into the ship’s queer culture, we realized that this is just more of what it was.

Do you think of the show as a reexamination of the record in that sense?

Well, no, because at the same time, you wouldn’t want to meet the real Blackbeard. The real Blackbeard was a rapist who handed women over to his crew. The real Stede Bonnet was a slave owner. When we tell these stories, we have to be clear with what we’re doing because all of these people were despicable. To make a fictionalized version of this history, though, I think you have to try to staff a room where people have lived-in experiences that they can bring to the story, and we have to talk about things we’re experiencing now because these stories are timeless.

In talking to the room while we were building it, we kept asking, “What do we want the show to be?” And the consensus in that very diverse room was that we wanted to show that isn’t just wallowing in trauma. We don’t have to do a coming out scene or focusing on the trauma of it — not to say that those stories aren’t valid. But we wanted a show where these characters can exist in a fantasy world and their race or gayness doesn’t automatically lead to a traumatic storyline for them. We have a lot of shows where...

That’s the point?

Yeah, someone’s sexuality in a period piece is met with dire consequences. We have a lot that, you know? So what if we just didn’t do it.

When you meet the nun who raised Jim in “This Is Happening,” she’s so matter-of-fact about them having always been more or less the way they are and raising them to seek revenge.

We had so many different permutations of the nun, and it was just great. Like, I’m old, man, so when I’m talking about these things, I’m trying to keep up with everyone and understand and ask the right questions. When you staff your room well, they’ll lead you there if you listen and say, “What can we do with this nun beyond the obvious?”

I feel like that’s very much a thing creators talk about now — the importance of making sure that their rooms have that kind of dynamism and diversity in them, but I’m curious to hear what those things mean to you as the creator of something like Our Flag Means Death.

I don’t know how anyone else does it, but for me, I think gender balance is great in a room, and non-binary writers are a part of that. The first thing is, can you write? Do I want to go on a 20-week car trip with you and vice versa? “Yes, and” is the most important thing in the room because if you get people who are “no, but,” the work is heavier on everyone’s shoulders, and then it is really just being like, “Who were the most interesting writers out there?” There is a demographic component to it that I think people shy away from, but it is what it is. I know that I want X, Y and Z perspectives in the room.

The show about the slave-owning pirate should probably have some people of color in the writers’ room.

Right, and it’s not checking off a diversity list with a golf pencil but really being honest with yourself and asking, “Do I have the perspectives and terms of race, gender, sexuality to create a shared sociological imagination?” It’s fucked up because you write a show and a lot of the plaudits go to you, the showrunner, and it’s like you’re using all of these brains. You know, you have this horsepower of all of these writers like this. The season is the function of all of these brains coming together and creating one sociological imagination.

"After launching as “IMDb Freedive” back in 2019, IMDb TV quickly faded into the background of the ongoing streaming wars that parent company Amazon had already established a respectable foothold in. While that initial rebrand never quite managed to put the fledgling platform and its content on the map, Amazon’s just announced its plan to reintroduce the streamer yet again under new branding ahead of a massive content push.

Going forward, IMDb TV will be known as “Amazon Freevee,” a name meant to emphasize that the ad-supported platform is free to viewers. In a press release detailing its vision for Freevee’s future, director Ashraf Alkarmi framed the service as a supplemental platform meant to appeal to consumers interested in watching “premium” series and films with significantly fewer commercial interruptions.

“Customers are increasingly shifting to streaming ad-supported premium content, and we have developed Freevee to deliver them highly sought content with half the commercials of traditional TV,” Alkarmi said. “Our new name clearly communicates who we are: An easy-to-navigate streaming service, available to users for free, whenever and wherever they choose to watch some of the greatest Original and licensed content available.”

Though Freevee will feature a certain amount of licensed content, the streamer’s banking on its original programming like Bosch: Legacy and a scripted adaptation of Tegan and Sara’s High School memoir from Clea DuVall. While Freevee plans to grow its slate of original programming by 70 percent by the end of the year, what’s going to ultimately determine the platform’s success is whether people end up watching it. It’s certainly possible that the third time will be the charm for Amazon Freevee, but at this mature and intense stage of the larger streaming game, a wealth of content doesn’t necessarily ensure success.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23023835/imdb-tv-amazon-freevee-rebrand,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NoFjb-eQGgxaxKXDm7vkQmBrtuI=/0x25:1357x735/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23387407/Freevee.jpeg,Verge
"When Russell T. Davies’ original Queer as Folk first premiered on Channel 4 back in 1999, it made a name for itself with its frank and often joyful depictions of queer lives with a particular focus on sex. Showtime’s 2000 adaptation led with a similar focus that established its spin on Queer as Folk as a cultural phenomenon and changed the landscape of American TV. Now, Peacock’s banking that the Queer as Folk brand still has enough of that old magic to make its upcoming reboot stand out in an era when networks and streaming services have long since come around to the idea of telling sexy stories about queer club goers.

Today, Peacock released a new teaser along with details and a series of images from Stephen Dunn’s Queer as Folk, a reimagining of both its predecessors. Though the teaser doesn’t actually feature any footage from the show, it establishes that the new Queer as Folk will once again revolve around a club called Babylon, where a number of its characters’ lives intersect.

Grid View











In a press release about the series, Dunn recalled how he, like many ’90s queer kids, grew up watching Queer as Folk and immediately being struck simply being seeing a television show that gave queer characters the space and freedom to be fully formed people. Though the new show is definitely taking cues from its predominantly white predecessors, Dunn noted that this Queer as Folk’s creative team took care to build its story with the queer community’s actual diversity in mind.

“I wanted to create a new groundbreaking version of this show for this moment,” Dunn said. “Our new Queer as Folk is set in New Orleans — one of the most unique queer communities in North America — and I am immensely proud that the new series is comprised of an electric ensemble of fresh characters that mirror the modern global audience.”

Queer as Folk stars Devin Way, Fin Argus, Jesse James Keitel, Candace Grace, Johnny Sibilly, and Ryan O’Connell. The series hits Peacock on June 9th.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23023548/peacock-queer-as-folk-teaser,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sjPSivGNyVVeT1CA7Bs7K-VteJ0=/0x420:5622x3363/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23386857/NUP_196327_00896R.jpeg,Verge
"As Nadia Vulvokov realized how she was trapped in a never-ending cycle of death and do-overs in Russian Doll’s first season, her familiarity with the concept of time loops helped her escape one. Nadia’s self-awareness about her predicament was a major part of what kept Russian Doll from feeling like a simple Groundhog Day riff with little to add to the genre. That cosmic knowingness is also one of the reasons Russian Doll’s second season makes for such an unexpectedly different and fascinating puzzle box as it takes the series to its next level with another tale of metaphysical birthday madness.

Russian Doll’s second season picks up a few years after the previous and just days before Nadia’s (Natasha Lyonne) 40th birthday. As always, Nadia fully intends to spend the day of her birth with loved ones like Maxine (Greta Lee) and Ruth (Elizabeth Ashley), and she’s confident that she’s going to be able to make good on her plans because — for the first time in a while — she feels in control of her life.

More than any specific setting details, it’s Nadia’s interactions with neighborhood pillars like Horse (Brendan Sexton III) and bodega owner Farran (Ritesh Rajan) that give you a sense of how much everyone has lived in the gap between Russian Doll’s first and second seasons. After spending the past few of Nadia’s birthdays together and on high alert in case they were sucked into another loop, she and Alan (Charlie Barnett) have had the chance to develop a genuine friendship and shared sense of safety with one another that helps keep them both grounded.

Russian Doll pads its story with a healthy dose of urban legends

Despite Alan and Nadia having more than earned their right to be in perpetual states of anxiety about their places in the universe, Russian Doll’s second chapter leads with the idea that their previous experiences have changed them for the better. Neither Nadia nor Alan’s neuroses are ever all that far away, though, and a substantial part of Russian Doll’s story here is a mind-bending exploration of how the two of them got to be that way in the first place. Similar to how the new season of Russian Doll doesn’t spend as much time reminding you that Nadia’s a video game developer, the show doesn’t try to frame its new time-traveling conceit as a surprise. Rather, Russian Doll presents it as the universe challenging both Alan and Nadia to better understand themselves and how uniquely situated in reality they’ve always been.

Russian Doll once again presumes that you, like Nadia, have consumed enough stories about time travel to know the rules about what people should and shouldn’t do if they spontaneously find themselves transported to the distant past. Season two raises the stakes and puts a unique spin on the genre, though, by padding its story with a healthy dose of urban legends and batshit left turns that all complement Lyonne’s performance as a consummate New Yorker who — mostly — knows no fear.

The importance of living in the moment is one of the larger ideas that shapes much of Russian Doll’s plot as Nadia and Alan begin bouncing back and forth between the present day and important moments from their past that are somehow connected by New York’s subway system. In any other series, the absurdity of a time-traveling MTA train guiding people to crucial points in their lives might almost be enough to derail the entire endeavor, but it works here because of this season’s focus on how nonsensical things become important parts of people’s identities.

Though much of this season is about Nadia looking back on her life, Russian Doll also delves into her interiority by way of her mother, Lenora (Chloë Sevigny), a paranoid schizophrenic with her own history of moving through the world in ways that “normal” people don’t. Russian Doll’s first season gave us a taste of what Nadia’s childhood with Lenora was like, but season 2 is a proper study of what it meant for Lenora to be a single mother in the ’80s struggling to support a family with few resources at her disposal. Both Lyonne — who also serves as showrunner — and Sevigny bring Nadia and Lenora to life with a raw intensity that feels new despite it gelling with what we’ve seen of the characters in the past.

While Russian Doll’s taking on a slightly different kind of sci-fi / supernatural trope this season, what’s pleasantly surprising is how uninterested the series is in deconstructing said trope outside of a handful of jokes. Russian Doll knows that you’ve probably seen Back to the Future and thought about what sorts of investments you’d want to make if you woke up in the past, which is why it spends so much of its time pushing you and its protagonists to think more deeply about what’s happening to them.

The more you settle into the Murakami-like pacing and sensibilities of Russian Doll’s new mystery, the more satisfying this seven-episode-long season ends up being as it begins to increasingly rely on a fuzzy kind of dream logic. The clarity that Nadia and Alan are initially able to view their situations with doesn’t endure, but it’s replaced by a perspective that’s far more interesting and leaves open the possibility for even more Russian Doll down the line.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23020726/russian-doll-season-2-review-netflix,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9h4kL0jY1mr3XC4z5AWOyXn788o=/0x124:2759x1569/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23382455/RussianDoll_Season2_Episode1_00_21_43_18R.jpeg,Verge

"In the age of binge-watching and television seasons that drop all at once, Severance feels unique: it’s a show you definitely don’t want to watch in one go. Despite the veneer of a banal workplace drama, Severance is an incredibly tense sci-fi horror series where that tension only builds over the course of the show’s nine episodes. Each new chapter is a chance to see something more messed up and discover the dark depths the capitalist machine is willing to sink to. You’re going to want some space in between to let it all soak in — and maybe catch your breath a little.

This article contains spoilers for the first season of Severance.

Severance starts out fairly slowly. The show centers on a relatively new procedure called, naturally, severance, which splits a worker’s brain in two. This allows people to essentially skip work for eight hours a day and focus on their outside life. The work self, meanwhile (the two are colloquially referred to as “innies” and “outies”), is stuck in a life that is nothing but work. Their entire lives are contained to the office. The technology allows memories to be spatially dictated. Your life and memories are yours right up until you hop in the elevator at Lumon Industries, go down to the severed floor, and get to work. From that point on, your time and memories belong to your innie — and to Lumon.

Related The weird computers and claustrophobic hallways of Severance

We’re introduced to the concept through Mark (Adam Scott). On the outside, Mark is grieving the loss of his wife, and he signed up to be severed in hopes of avoiding those feelings for at least part of the day. On the inside, he’s the chipper department head of the macrodata refinement division at Lumon, where he and three other employees — Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) — spend all day long doing… something. It’s never actually clear what their job is, though they’re reassured the work is mysterious and important. It mostly involves finding “scary” numbers on a bewildering grid.

Initially, it’s easy to see the appeal of severing. Work sucks. Who wouldn’t want to cut that drudgery out of their lives and focus on the good parts? But it quickly becomes clear just how untenable the solution is. For the innies, it’s an actual nightmare. Their lives exist only within the dreary walls of Lumon’s basement. When they leave work, their next memory is of arriving the next day. They feel the effects of sleep, but they never experience it themselves. Things get so bleak that collecting office trinkets like Lumon-branded finger traps becomes an actual incentive. At one point, a contraband book of New Age philosophical gibberish makes its way into the department, and the refiners treat it like the most important piece of literature ever written. After all, when the only thing you’ve ever read is an employee handbook, anything would be good by comparison.

The sense of discomfort — and, eventually, outright terror — grows as the show progresses, and you learn more about Lumon and what life is like in the basement. The company itself is a bit like if Amazon was run by Scientologists, only a lot more evil. We’re told that it’s a pharmaceutical company with its hands in a lot of different industries. Much of the staff — at least those we see, including Mark’s boss, played with a terrifying intensity by Patricia Arquette — worship its founder like a religious figure, right down to the constant repetition of dogma. In the optics and design division, you can find, among other disturbing Romantic era-style paintings of interdepartmental wars, a version of Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, featuring Lumon founder Kier Eagan staring out into the great unknown.

Severance thrives on mystery. Like Lost and Yellowjackets, it’s a show that loves to toss inexplicable curveballs at viewers that are sometimes explained, sometimes not. In Severance, those strange twists are often the reason for the steadily creeping sense of dread. Some of this comes down to the way the show looks: the severed floor is like something out of a parallel dimension. It’s almost like a cubicle farm ripped out of the ‘60s, but with strange retrofuturistic computers, twisting hallways designed for maximum confusion, and a breakroom that doubles as a psychological torture chamber. Oh, and there’s a room filled with baby goats. It’s the kind of show where a celebratory waffle party inevitably devolves into something bizarre and uncomfortable.

This sense of mystery is amplified by the dual nature of the severed characters. Each actor is essentially playing two different people with conflicting desires. But by nature of their surgically altered brains, they only know half of the story. Outie Mark has no idea what really goes on during the hours he’s at the office, and innie Mark knows literally nothing about the outside world and the impact that widespread adoption of severance could have. You may be confused while watching, but the characters in the show have things much, much worse. I should also note that Severance’s creators have a clear love of artful cliffhangers of the “Not Penny’s boat” variety. This extends to the finale, which, while answering some important questions and offering some explosive revelations, also leaves a lot to be uncovered in Severance’s recently confirmed second season. You may shout at your screen when the credits kick in.

"In the age of binge-watching and television seasons that drop all at once, Severance feels unique: it’s a show you definitely don’t want to watch in one go. Despite the veneer of a banal workplace drama, Severance is an incredibly tense sci-fi horror series where that tension only builds over the course of the show’s nine episodes. Each new chapter is a chance to see something more messed up and discover the dark depths the capitalist machine is willing to sink to. You’re going to want some space in between to let it all soak in — and maybe catch your breath a little.

This article contains spoilers for the first season of Severance.

Severance starts out fairly slowly. The show centers on a relatively new procedure called, naturally, severance, which splits a worker’s brain in two. This allows people to essentially skip work for eight hours a day and focus on their outside life. The work self, meanwhile (the two are colloquially referred to as “innies” and “outies”), is stuck in a life that is nothing but work. Their entire lives are contained to the office. The technology allows memories to be spatially dictated. Your life and memories are yours right up until you hop in the elevator at Lumon Industries, go down to the severed floor, and get to work. From that point on, your time and memories belong to your innie — and to Lumon.

Related The weird computers and claustrophobic hallways of Severance

We’re introduced to the concept through Mark (Adam Scott). On the outside, Mark is grieving the loss of his wife, and he signed up to be severed in hopes of avoiding those feelings for at least part of the day. On the inside, he’s the chipper department head of the macrodata refinement division at Lumon, where he and three other employees — Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) — spend all day long doing… something. It’s never actually clear what their job is, though they’re reassured the work is mysterious and important. It mostly involves finding “scary” numbers on a bewildering grid.

Initially, it’s easy to see the appeal of severing. Work sucks. Who wouldn’t want to cut that drudgery out of their lives and focus on the good parts? But it quickly becomes clear just how untenable the solution is. For the innies, it’s an actual nightmare. Their lives exist only within the dreary walls of Lumon’s basement. When they leave work, their next memory is of arriving the next day. They feel the effects of sleep, but they never experience it themselves. Things get so bleak that collecting office trinkets like Lumon-branded finger traps becomes an actual incentive. At one point, a contraband book of New Age philosophical gibberish makes its way into the department, and the refiners treat it like the most important piece of literature ever written. After all, when the only thing you’ve ever read is an employee handbook, anything would be good by comparison.

The sense of discomfort — and, eventually, outright terror — grows as the show progresses, and you learn more about Lumon and what life is like in the basement. The company itself is a bit like if Amazon was run by Scientologists, only a lot more evil. We’re told that it’s a pharmaceutical company with its hands in a lot of different industries. Much of the staff — at least those we see, including Mark’s boss, played with a terrifying intensity by Patricia Arquette — worship its founder like a religious figure, right down to the constant repetition of dogma. In the optics and design division, you can find, among other disturbing Romantic era-style paintings of interdepartmental wars, a version of Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, featuring Lumon founder Kier Eagan staring out into the great unknown.

Severance thrives on mystery. Like Lost and Yellowjackets, it’s a show that loves to toss inexplicable curveballs at viewers that are sometimes explained, sometimes not. In Severance, those strange twists are often the reason for the steadily creeping sense of dread. Some of this comes down to the way the show looks: the severed floor is like something out of a parallel dimension. It’s almost like a cubicle farm ripped out of the ‘60s, but with strange retrofuturistic computers, twisting hallways designed for maximum confusion, and a breakroom that doubles as a psychological torture chamber. Oh, and there’s a room filled with baby goats. It’s the kind of show where a celebratory waffle party inevitably devolves into something bizarre and uncomfortable.

This sense of mystery is amplified by the dual nature of the severed characters. Each actor is essentially playing two different people with conflicting desires. But by nature of their surgically altered brains, they only know half of the story. Outie Mark has no idea what really goes on during the hours he’s at the office, and innie Mark knows literally nothing about the outside world and the impact that widespread adoption of severance could have. You may be confused while watching, but the characters in the show have things much, much worse. I should also note that Severance’s creators have a clear love of artful cliffhangers of the “Not Penny’s boat” variety. This extends to the finale, which, while answering some important questions and offering some explosive revelations, also leaves a lot to be uncovered in Severance’s recently confirmed second season. You may shout at your screen when the credits kick in.

Put it all together, and you have a show that paints the darkest possible portrait of how megacorporations think about and treat their employees. We’ve all seen the stories of what tech giants try to get away with in the real world; Severance posits a future where they can do literally anything in secret because employees have knowingly signed up to be lab rats. If things go Lumon’s way, no one will ever know about the goats or the breakroom. That tension and terror are worth it, though.

"In the vast underground office of Lumon, the megacorporation at the heart of Apple TV Plus’ thriller Severance, the computers are downright bizarre. At first they look a bit like an old Mac, but the closer you look, the more strange they become. The CRT display is somehow a touchscreen. The beautiful blue keyboard is saddled with a gigantic trackball. The goal, production designer Jeremy Hindle tells The Verge, was to design a device that doesn’t make a lot of sense, mirroring the purgatory-like world that exists only within Lumon’s basement. “The idea was that anything you could see underground doesn’t exist up top anywhere,” says Hindle. “You’ll never see that computer or that keyboard.”

This article contains light spoilers for Severance.

Severance takes place in a world where a new procedure — the titular severance — allows workers to split their lives in two after a little brain surgery. They essentially become two people: one who lives a relatively normal life and another whose entire existence resides in a purgatory-like office. Because of this, the design of the office itself was extremely important. It needed to feel like a place outside of time and space. “You have to make sure that the inside and outside world are [different] enough that you’re immersed in the world, so you feel like you’re severed when you’re down there with them,” explains Hindle.

The starting point was offices from the 1960s. “They’re working in this office environment, and they’re brought in to just be these pro-workers, and they’re birthed into the place,” Hindle says. “It should be like what offices used to be like. Beautiful desks, beautiful structures, beautiful lights. Just about work. On the desk there’s one pen, a rolodex, a phone. It felt like it had to be that same tone — but way more playful.”

At first glance, the offices in Severance look fairly normal. They’re brightly lit with clean white walls and carpeted green floors. But in the macrodata refinement wing — where much of the show takes place — things are a little off. Despite having a huge room, the four workers are crammed together via a cluster of desks in the middle of the space. From there, things get even stranger. The hallways, designed with the intention of making people lost, twist and turn in confusing ways, and there are rooms filled with 3D printers and baby goats.

“It’s not a spaceship, but it is a spaceship.”

The breakroom, despite its name, is a bleak, dark place where employees are punished for breaking the rules. In order to access it, they’re forced down a long, narrow, and dimly lit hallway that’s barely wide enough for a single person. “The space is what makes people feel uncomfortable when they watch it,” says Hindle. “In [macrodata refinement] the ceiling is so low, so even though the room is a football field, it’s claustrophobic in a strange way.” (According to Hindle, series creator Dan Erickson once drew him a map of the labyrinth basement, which he describes as a “maze.”)

The next step was perfecting the smaller details because the underground office is meant to be its own little world. “It’s not a spaceship, but it is a spaceship,” Hindle says, citing the original Alien as a big source of inspiration. That meant that everything in it, from the desks with their adjustable dividers and the snacks in the vending machine to the finger traps given out as bonuses had to be created in-house. Hindle estimates that the production team designed around 100 different products to be used in the office, all meant to evoke the Lumon aesthetic.

Which takes us back to the computers. Those Lumon rigs, which employees use to find “scary” numbers in a Minesweeper-like program, look like they were hacked together from several other machines. “The trackball just cracked me up,” Hindle says. “We kept thinking, ‘If you’re experimenting with these people, what would you put in front of them?’” Not only were they designed to look out of time, but also to give the cast of office drones — which includes the likes of Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, and a very charming John Turturro — something to play around with while acting. “Imagine how fun it would be to sit at this thing, as opposed to if I put a laptop in front of them,” Hindle says. “It’s like a child’s device.”

Hindle says that the computers are functional and that the actors are really messing with numbers on screen during the show. The machines also went through multiple revisions before production began to get the size just right (among other things), so that they were large enough to be a focal point but small enough to not obscure the actors or interfere with their eyelines. As Hindle notes, “They’re in this room for three hours in the first season. It had to be pretty special and pretty fun.”

When you combine all of these elements — the retrofuturistic computers, the labyrinth layout, the ‘60s decor, the claustrophobic hallways — and add in voyeuristic cinematography that’s often reminiscent of security camera footage, you end up with a show that’s both instantly familiar and uncomfortably strange. In these offices, even a dance party takes on a tinge of horror, which, given one of Hindle’s main inspirations, shouldn’t be too surprising.

“It really was my Twin Peaks,” he explains. “The similarity is that they have a tone to the writing, the art direction, the design, the cinematography. It is its own world.”","Andrew Webster, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/23013413/severance-apple-tv-plus-production-design-computers,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69ZuuiG44aHj_Yn9m_gVtzYd4EM=/0x591:8256x4914/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371548/ATV_Severance_Photo_010203.jpg,Verge

"Though the original Orphan Black series seemingly brought the story of Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) and her sprawling family tree of sister clones to a close, AMC’s gearing up to return to their world with an all-new live-action series.

Per The Hollywood Reporter, AMC Networks has tapped Fear The Walking Dead supervising producer Anna Fishko to write and showrun Orphan Black: Echoes, a new series set in the near future of the original. The new show, which is set to be executive produced and directed by John Fawcett, will follow the lives of a new group of women who gradually begin to realize how deeply interconnected their origins are — despite the fact that none of them know one another. Given how the original Orphan Black came to a close, it’s unclear whether Echoes will see Maslany return to reprise any of her core Clone Club roles or one of the dozens of other Leda clones that were still living out in the world by the series finale. Currently, Orphan Black: Echoes doesn’t have a firm release date, but AMC expects the series to premiere sometime in 2023.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/6/23013449/orphan-black-echoes-amc,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/elj7tdTkTeqtOKPrLIY-18H-xk8=/0x86:1134x680/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371629/Lepore_History_Lurking_Behind_Orphan_Black.jpeg,Verge
"To answer the question of why we should care about Paramount Plus, the service is going back to the well of nostalgia and snagging some of our favorite Star Trek: The Next Generation characters to be featured in season 3 of Star Trek: Picard.

A brief trailer for the news shows just Patrick Stewart in his role as Jean-Luc Picard but uses voiceovers to tease the upcoming appearances of LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, and Brent Spiner.

Without showing them, it’s unclear if we’ll see the use of often-controversial de-aging technology applied to the stars or if there’s any other plan to deal with the impact of time and plot circumstances. Guinan’s return in season 2 has included both Whoopi Goldberg and a new performer, Ito Aghayere, assuming the role of young Guinan, as well as some timeline chicanery. So anything seems possible for William Riker, Beverly Crusher, Geordi La Forge, Deanna Troi, Worf, and Data.

The third season will be Picard’s last, and in a statement, showrunner and EP Terry Matalas says “it’s most fitting that the story of Jean-Luc Picard ends honoring the beginning, with his dearest and most loyal friends from the U.S.S. Enterprise.” Co-EP Christopher Monfette confirmed the third season finished filming last month.

There’s no release date mentioned for the show’s third season, although season 2 is still airing, with new episodes arriving each Thursday and episode 6 poised to drop this week.

"The live-action Halo show on Paramount Plus is already onto its second episode this week, but the first one is now available for free on YouTube. As long as you’re in the US, you can access the first episode of Halo on YouTube.

The Halo show is nothing like the games, and Verge video games reporter Ash Parrish, a self-confessed Halo lore hobbyist, says it “offers a far more compelling look at the Master Chief than anything the games have done so far.”

Halo stars Pablo Schreiber of American Gods as Master Chief, Natascha McElhone of Californication as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor, the voice actress for Cortana in the Halo games, as Master Chief’s AI assistant. The show has already been renewed for a second season, and debuted on Paramount Plus on March 24th.

This isn’t the first time streaming services have tried to entice people into subscriptions with free episodes on YouTube. The pilot episode of the Star Trek: Picard series appeared on YouTube a couple of years ago, and Tuca & Bertie’s first episode of season two is also on YouTube free of charge.

"HBO’s upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff, House of the Dragon, will debut on HBO and HBO Max on August 21st. The company announced the date Wednesday with a picture of what appears to be a hatching dragon egg — which hopefully means we’ll see at least one of the terrifying beasts in the upcoming show.

"HBO’s upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff, House of the Dragon, will debut on HBO and HBO Max on August 21st. The company announced the date Wednesday with a picture of what appears to be a hatching dragon egg — which hopefully means we’ll see at least one of the terrifying beasts in the upcoming show.

"Farmers don’t get embarrassed when the price of corn drops; similarly, there’s no reason for startup founders to lose their joy because publicly traded tech stocks are undercutting their valuations.

If making as much money as you can is your primary goal, however, prepare to be disappointed. Accepting a down round or a smaller seed check isn’t a sign of failure — as it says in the Bible: the rain falls on the just, and the unjust.

“While the market has quickly turned to favor the buyers, the good news is that it isn’t broken,” according to Jeremy Abelson and Jacob Sonnenberg of Irving Investors.

In a TC+ guest post, they share a calculator for using growth metrics and public market valuations that can help founding teams “triangulate to a more company-specific enterprise value.”

The numbers don’t lie — for all but a few strong contenders, the IPO window is now closed.

But if you have an idea for a product or service that might be valuable to others, spending your days working for someone else is a questionable choice, no matter what’s happening in the stock market.

Cram downs are a character test for VCs and founders

Follow-on investors who take advantage of the closing IPO window to foist unfavorable terms on founders are “the bottom feeders of the venture capital business,” writes Steve Blank.

As the public markets contract and startup valuations follow suit, it’s common for entrepreneurs who have invested years of their lives into a startup to accept “take-it-or-leave-it” terms, says Blank, an adjunct professor at Stanford and senior fellow for Innovation at Columbia University.

Ultimately, “VCs will stop playing this game when founders stop negotiating.”

How to think like an investor: Understanding the actual cost of fundraising

Founders in fundraising mode are usually laser-focused on the task at hand, but now that valuations are a moving target, it might be useful to borrow an investor’s perspective.

“The presumption that a company knows what its investors expect with full clarity is a lofty one,” says Rebecca Mitchem, a partner at Neotribe Ventures.

In a post aimed at growth-stage entrepreneurs, Mitchem answers three questions:

How expensive is venture capital (as defined by the amount of dilution)? What financial milestones will investors expect me to reach between each raise? What are the more subjective milestones I need to hit to evidence I’m ready for the next raise?

Steer’s Anuja Sonalker explains the benefits of chasing the less glitzy side of autonomy

In the AV industry, the ultimate goal is to create vehicles that can operate in every situation that a human driver could navigate.

It’s a difficult problem to solve: driving is a collection of acquired and practiced skills – negotiating a traffic jam requires a much different set of skills than parallel parking.

“Nobody is going to solve everything. Everybody is going to master one area and then work with others to create that end-to-end ecosystem,” Steer Tech founder and CEO Anuja Sonalker told Rebecca Bellan.

In their interview, Sonalker discusses the importance of automotive cybersecurity, how automating the “endpoint” makes freight more efficient, and why focusing on less glamorous tech can help companies build better products.

MLB forays into the future with new tech for the old ball game

Baseball has come a long way since 1897, when a Princeton math professor designed a pitching machine that ran on gunpowder.

Today, baseball is a technology-driven enterprise where team owners, players, media organizations and individual fans have access to reams of raw statistics.

To learn more about Major League Baseball’s tech stack, enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed its CPO and head of engineering, Vasanth Williams.

“MLB has a long history of leveraging data and technology, and being an early adopter of a lot of the technologies, which I love doing,” he said.

An inside look at a Ukrainian fintech startup adapting to life during wartime

In the 54 days since Russia began its invasion, Ukraine’s IT community has mobilized tools to assist its citizens and military, such as volunteering offices to house displaced citizens and helping employees move out of active war zones, writes Nelia Holovina, a senior content writer at 42Flows.Tech.

In a post for TechCrunch+, Holovina explains how shifting company operations to digital helped them prepare for the war and maintain productivity, even as many workers have put down laptops and picked up arms.

“It is believed that demand for IT will remain high, and the IT sector itself may become the new driver of the economy,” she writes. “The situation depends entirely on how long this war will last and how it will end.”

"Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing around the world, with the company telling shareholders Tuesday that it is a “big opportunity” for the streaming giant to help turn around its fortunes.

The company reported a quarterly subscriber loss Tuesday, ending Q1 of 2022 with 221.64 million subscribers, down from 221.84 million in Q4 of 2021.

In its shareholder letter, Netflix cited “the large number of households sharing accounts” as a critical factor “creating revenue growth headwinds.” Specifically Netflix estimates that “over 100 million” households worldwide are using shared Netflix accounts, including more than 30 million in the U.S. and Canada.

“This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service,” the company wrote in its letter. “Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we’ve always tried to make sharing within a member’s household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households.”

Netflix began to test out potential password-sharing effort last year, and this March, the company rolled out a pilot program in Costa Rica, Peru and Chile that would let users add additional members outside of their households if the company ID’ed that a password was being shared.

On Tuesday, the company left no doubt that the crackdown will expand in the near future.

“There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing,” the company said. “So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity.”

Still, Netflix noted that “account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years,” but added that the COVID-spurred subscriber pull-forward obscured the impact that password sharing had on its business.",Alex Weprin,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-coming-1235132170/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-869378032-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"A lot of cosmic eyeballs were on the Thor: Love and Thunder teaser that dropped Monday.

The first look at the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe installment received over 209 million views in its first 24 hours of release, across all digital platforms.

That puts the preview in the top tier of Marvel trailers for most views in a day, behind Avengers: Infinity War (230 million) and Avengers: Endgame (289 million). However, the crown still belongs to Spider-Man: No Way Home, which raked in an astonishing 355.5 million views in its first 24 hours.

Backed by the Guns N’ Roses’ classic “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” the Marvel Studios teaser is nearly two minutes long. It opens with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) getting back into amazing shape after the God of Thunder packed on a few pounds during a five-year time jump in Avengers: Endgame.

The bright, stylish trailer sets the tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form, who directed the popular Thor: Ragnarok and returned to the director’s chair for Love and Thunder. The film will also feature the Guardians of the Galaxy and Tessa Thompson reprising her fan-favorite role as Valkyrie.

Of course, the biggest moment in the trailer is the conclusion, when Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster is unveiled as Mighty Thor.

Thor: Love and Thunder arrives in theaters July 8.

"A longtime creative exec, Mo Marable was best known for directing TV titles (see Big Love and the enduringly familiar Entourage opener) before the most unlikely of breaks got him behind the camera of narrative comedies such as The Game, Miracle Workers and Insecure.

It was a short for the 2014 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the one where Julia Louis-Dreyfus and then-Vice President Joe Biden darted around D.C. in a cameo-filled parody, that changed the course of his career. Now a producing director on two series — Hulu’s Woke, which recently dropped its entire second season, and Peacock’s Killing It, which just premiered on April 14 — Marable has now worked on nearly 20 series and become a go-to choice for comedy pilots. Zooming in from the Nova Scotia shoot of Hulu’s Washington Black adaptation in early April, the director spoke about his trajectory, the increasingly polarizing idea of “wokeness” and hopes for his feature debut: a Disney+ update of 1980s comedy Three Men and a Baby.

It only recently came to my attention that you were the one who directed that insane White House Correspondents’ Dinner video with our now president and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. How’d you land that?

How I got there was crazy. I used to work at HBO, in the creative services promo department, but I had left and started my own production company. HBO, no matter who’s there, will always be family to me. They called me to do a promo for Veep, and I was like, “I don’t do promos anymore.” But then, of course, I shot it. Three weeks later I get a call for another Veep thing. “Just read it,” they said. So, I did, but I go, “Who are we going to get to play Joe Biden?” Turns out: Joe Biden. How do you say “no” to that? Next thing I know, I’m in D.C. and walking around the Oval Office. Every location we had, whether it was in The White House or Congress or whatever, we only had 15 minutes to shoot. I remember at one point the Obamas’ dog [Bo or Sunny] runs in and stops, looks at me, and then just walks out. “Wrong brother,” I said, “Wrong brother.”

Going into this, you’d worked with Julia — but obviously not with Joe Biden or Michelle Obama, who made a memorable cameo.

Working with Julia and [Veep creator] Armando Iannucci, we just hunkered down for like three or four days and created this piece together. But we had a lot of pivots, like the First Lady. We got a call on the second day saying, “Michelle Obama wants in.” And you already know what happens. She’s all about fitness and eating healthy, but she’s eating all of that ice cream. We had 15 minutes to shoot that. One thing I will say about Michelle Obama is that she has such a spirit and an energy. You can feel it far away. So we’re in there, and The White House assistants were just like, “She’ll be ready in five minutes… two minutes…” all of a sudden all these secret service men are in the room. I don’t know if I’m making this up, because it’s just the way I thought I saw her, but she came in and she was like, “Hey!”

When she hit her time limit, I needed one more shot to make it all work. “Ma’am, is it OK if I just shoot this one shot?” And Joe Biden lit me up. “She is the First Lady of the United States! You just can’t ask her that!” And Michelle just goes, “Joe.” She turns to me and says, “Mo, what do you need?” She says it’s fine, and then Joe just smiles. It was such a wonderful experience, and that was the narrative turning point of my career.

You really started racking up credits at that point.



That hit on Saturday night, during Correspondents’ Dinner, and then it was all over the news. That Monday I got a phone call to direct a TV show. It happened, just like that.

You hear a lot about directors shifting from music videos to TV and features but not from branded content. Do you think that you would’ve been able to segue into the career you have now without that moment?



I don’t know. My goal was always to become a director. When you’re young, you just think like everything’s possible. You don’t even know what the game is. You don’t know that some of this is inside baseball or nepotism. Not everybody who works hard and does good work gets to win. I got to a point where I was just satisfied that I wasn’t broke. “Oh, I can go on a vacation with my friends? Well, if I don’t ever do narrative, that’s cool.” But the reality is I never doubted that I was going to transition at some point.

The very first show they gave me a shot was The Game, Mara [Brock] and Salim Akil. That was the first phone call I got the day after the Correspondents’ Dinner thing came out. And in this business, you need somebody to vouch for you. You need somebody to say, “Take that shot.” Then I directed Veep, which I think would’ve happened anyway because of the short. From there it was It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and things just picked up.

Since Woke originally premiered almost two years ago — and the timing of it is still kind of surreal, since that long-ignored conversation really came to the fore that summer — some things have changed and simultaneously nothing has change. But one big development is the that term “woke” has been weaponized by the right.

When we sold the show, and again when we were getting ready to market it, we had a lot of meetings around, “Should we keep the name Woke?” Woke was already starting to feel overused. We batted all of these other ideas around, but at the end of the day we kept coming back to Woke. It was timely, because people were paying attention. Like you said, it’s always been there. Sadly, between George Floyd and a pandemic, there were just so many things at play. We were actually supposed to premiere the show maybe six weeks or eight weeks later — during election week, I think! Hulu was a real partner for doing everything to push it forward, throwing money at marketing to get it all going. But the word “woke” has been twisted and co-opted. It’s a slur in certain circles. That’s the reason our tagline this season is “Woke is a four-letter word.”

For sure, and the new season really gets into the complications of the term and even within the activist community.

It’s a racial slur and a kind of microaggression in certain areas. I don’t know who is proud of the word anymore — and I’m talking every group from the right to the left. What I think the show loves about it now is that it is so polarized. And the thing about wokeness is … can anybody truly be woke? After George Floyd happened, next thing you know there are corporations putting out so-called woke type messaging. Huh!? I had a neighbor bring over food after George Floyd was murdered. I remember standing in the yard by the porch and my wife was out front and I just saw it coming. Here’s the casserole. Then I heard, “I’m so sorry.” I was like, “I don’t fucking know Floyd like that! I’m not at the wake.” The symbol of what happened galvanized me, galvanized a lot of people, but then I’d get a phone call from somebody who I hadn’t worked with in 20 years, someone I don’t really know, saying “Hey, if you can, can you give me a call back? I just really want to talk to you, man.” Oh my God. I’m the one black friend for someone. So, part of Woke this season is about the misuse of the idea of wokeness. The idea that corporations try to co-opt it to make more money as a marketing tool. The idea that you can never really be woke. The idea that a lot of our woke leaders started making money.

The set-up for Killing It is almost too absurd to get into. How did you come to direct that pilot?



I had just done another pilot with Dan Goor, Grand Crew for NBC, so I read it and I just thought the script was hilarious — especially knowing that was Craig Robinson. It’s so weird. But I loved it because I never see these types of people — especially people of color and women — in this kind of space. Who’s going to think that Craig Robinson is going to play a snake hunter in the Florida bayous? Nobody. But this is what I’m trying to do nowadays. I’m now in a space where I really try to pick projects that actually have a social undercurrent. We’re talking about something. You may not see it right away, but if you start to pay attention, it’ll get closer and closer to you.

I’m not as outwardly political. Yes, I vote. I will go to a march. I will donate. If something in the workplace is not right, I’m going to speak up. But as a person out there, I’m not door-knocking. And sometimes I wonder: Am I doing enough? And I think where I do my best political work is in my work. At the end of the day, I really want to normalize African Americans and talk about the idea that the system is built to not allow everybody a piece of the pie.

Fewer and fewer people every year.

Every year. And [Robinson’s character] is just trying so hard to find a way to get his little plot of land. He’s not trying to be a criminal. He’s trying to do it the legit way, yet still he has a brother who’s like, “Nah, that’s not going to work.” It shows you this idea of how people get ahead. Being corrupt seems to have worked for a lot of people. Doing it the hard way hasn’t worked for some people, especially for people who have been marginalized already. I just find this tale of trying to achieve the American dream to be sad and real — even though we disguise it in all this crazy comedy.

You have to tell me something about your Three Men and a Baby reboot for Disney+. What’s your angle?

Well, here’s what I will say. I mean, again, I’m trying not to do anything that doesn’t speak to what’s going on in society today. When you go back and you watch the original Three Men and a Baby you go, “times have changed.”

Yes, hopefully these protagonists will have a different relationship with women,

Exactly. That’s a part of it. Zac Efron is still attached to play the lead. We are in the process of finishing up the script. I’m not making a Manhattan story. I making a Brooklyn story. It’s about these three guys, but guys are not as stupid as they were back in the day. The cast will be very diverse, that’s the only way I would do it, and we’ll see how Disney enjoys the script in the next six/seven weeks.

Will there be a reference to the weird ghost child cameo that was actually just the shadow of the cardboard cut-out of Ted Danson and a top hat?



If I get my druthers, yes. And I would love to have a cameo from one or all of them. I still want to pay homage to the original.",Mikey O'Connell,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/woke-killing-it-mo-marable-interview-1235131126/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MoMarable_4173_Erik-Umphery-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"Ezra Miller was arrested Tuesday morning on suspicion of second-degree assault, according to the Hawaii Island Police Department.

Around 1:30 a.m., Miller was taken into custody after an incident at a residence in Pāhoa, police said. The alleged assault occurred at a get-together at a private residence.

Miller, according to police, “became irate after being asked to leave and reportedly threw a chair, striking a 26-year-old female on the forehead, resulting in an approximate half-inch cut.”

Miller was arrested shortly thereafter, being located during a traffic stop, police said. The actor was released “pending further investigation,” police said.

In late March, The Flash star was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and harassment following an incident in a karaoke bar in Honolulu.

"Walter Mercado, the famed gender nonconforming Puerto Rican astrologer, is getting the TV treatment.

Eugenio Derbez’s 3Pas Studios and A Really Good Home Pictures are teaming with the estate of the late entertainer, Shanti LLC, to develop scripted and unscripted programming based on Mercado’s cultural influence and status as an icon within the Latinx and LGBTQ+ communities.

Mercado, most recently the subject of Netflix’s Mucho Mucho Amor: The Legend of Walter Mercado, started out as a dancer and actor in his native Puerto Rico and became a local TV personality after sharing astrological predictions in his signature robes and capes and would go on to become a cultural personality. His astrological shows also aired for decades in Latin America and the United States.

“I can think of no better partners than 3Pas Studios and A Really Good Home Pictures to present Walter’s life to the generations that loved him and those to come,” said Theodore B. Gekis, who manages Mercado’s estate and will oversee all projects that come through the deal. “Although Walter has passed on, his message about self-empowerment, self-acceptance and our interconnectedness with the universe live on in humankind and need to be celebrated daily. Love, spirituality, generosity and goodwill are universal, and become more and more relevant with each passing day. Walter was a man ahead of his time, and the time has come for the rest of us to catch up with him.”



Gekis will exec produce any and all potential projects alongside Derbez and his 3Pas Studios’ Ben Odell and Sonia Almanza Gambaro. ARGHP’s Andy Fraser and Katie Politanoff will oversee for the company.

“I have always deeply admired Walter and am personally thrilled to have the opportunity to honor his legacy of love, hope and positivity,” said Derbez, whose bilingual production company 3Pas remains based at Lionsgate (English-language films) and Televisa Univision streamer ViX (Spanish-language fare). 3Pas’ credits include Overboard, How to be a Latin Lover, Acapulco and the upcoming The Valet.

Mercado’s nieces, Aida Benet Suarez, Betty Benet Mercado, Dannette Benet Mercado and Ivonne Benet Mercado, control the Mercado estate, Shanti LLC. The latter trio continue to publish horoscopes and other astrology under the banner of Las Estrellas de Walter. “All of Walter’s nieces are excited that 3Pas Studios and Eugenio Derbez along with Andy Fraser and A Really Good Home Pictures will work together to help carry on our uncle Walter’s message of love, positivity and inclusion and introduce his legacy to new generations,” said Dannette Benet Mercado.

“I knew that we would need a partner with strong connections to Walter’s legacy — one that would also respect and continue to spread the love and community that Walter championed in life. 3Pas Studios, with Eugenio, Ben and Sonia, is an excellent fit and I’m thrilled they came on board,” said Fraser.

Derbez and 3Pas are repped by CAA and Behr Abramson. Shanti LLC is repped by Gekis and Daniel Ribera of Gekis Ribera Management.

"Music executive Clarence Avant (L) and Jacqueline Avant attend the BET AWARDS '14 Debra Lee's Pre-Dinner held at Milk Studios on June 28, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

A parolee who murdered 81-year-old philanthropist Jacqueline Avant, the wife of a legendary music executive, was sentenced Tuesday to 190 years in a California prison.

Aariel Maynor, 30, pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in Los Angeles Superior Court last month and admitted he used an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle to shoot Avant in her Beverly Hills home Dec. 1 and fired several rounds at her security guard as he fled.

Avant was married to Clarence Avant, a Grammy winner known as the “Godfather of Black Music” for mentoring and helping the careers of artists including Bill Withers, Little Willie John, L.A. Reid, Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

Maynor shot Jacqueline Avant in the back when she surprised him after he broke into the couple’s house during a burglary attempt in which he hoped to steal $50,000, prosecutors said. After fleeing the scene, he broke into a home in the Hollywood Hills and then accidentally shot himself in the foot as he was leaving.

Avant used her money for charities that helped low-income neighborhoods such as Watts and South Los Angeles. She was on the board of the International Student Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Clarence Avant, 91, a concert promoter and manager, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last year.

Prosecutors said Maynor had searched for information on Clarence Avant and the couple’s address the day before the killing.

Maynor showed no remorse for the slaying, bragging to a friend on a jail phone call about all the news stories about him and laughing, according to a court document filed by Deputy District Attorney Victor Avila.

“You think my mama’s seen that?” he asked.

“I don’t know, but that’s not funny,” the woman, who was not identified, said. “Why are you laughin’? That’s somebody’s life. That’s somebody’s family member.”

The Avants were married for 54 years and had two children, Alexander Du Bois Avant and Nicole Avant, a film producer and former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas who is married to Netflix co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos.

After Jacqueline Avant’s death, tributes were paid to her and her charitable work by former President Bill Clinton, Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Quincy Jones.

Maynor, who was on parole for his second robbery conviction, bragged to a friend during a jail call that he expected a shorter sentence because prosecutors were not seeking life without parole.

“I’m gonna get out of jail. I’ll probably do like 20 … 25, get out, you feel me?” he said.

Under District Attorney George Gascón, the office did not seek a special circumstance allegation that the killing was committed in the act of a burglary, which could have led to a possible sentence of life without parole.

Instead, prosecutors sought an enhanced penalty under the Three Strikes law where a third serious or violent felony can trigger a life sentence.",The Associated Press,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/jacquliene-avant-sentenced-prison-term-1235132068/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Jacqueline-Avant-BET-Awards-Arrivals-GettyImages-451418906-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"The last time I prayed, it was awkward — a reflection, really, of my relationship with God.

I’m sure with everything going on, the Lord isn’t judging me for my extended hiatus. But on that evening many months ago, when I decided to kneel beside my bed, clasp my hands and shut my eyes, I sincerely wondered if God was mad at me.

I wanted to ease the tension between us, so, naturally, I started my prayer with a joke: a brief bit about my absence, the state of the world, my anxieties, existential malaise. And it worked. My body loosened. My words become more animated, my storytelling more energetic. Humor has a way of doing that — soothing nerves and clearing the way for a sometimes destabilizing level of honesty.

I thought about my conversation with God while watching Jerrod Carmichael’s Rothaniel, a stunning and unnerving act of storytelling. The hour-long special, which premiered on HBO in early April, has already been written about considerably, with critics observing how it pushes stand-up into the realm of confession and functions as group therapy, or focusing on Carmichael’s brilliant use of silences, his coming out as gay and his engagement with the live audience. These pieces have rightly folded Carmichael into a new class of introspective, intimate stand-up specials, which include Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette, Bo Burnham’s Inside and even Pete Davidson’s Alive from New York.

I agree with many of these readings. But watching Rothaniel for a second, and then third, time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Carmichael was doing something more: that this comedian, who has already released two stand-up specials, a short-lived sitcom and a pair of brief personal documentaries — material in which he gestures at his sexuality, explores family secrets, confronts his parents and demonstrates a desire to build rapport with the audience — was trying to really push himself and viewers. Buoyed by the freedom found within humor, Rothaniel struck me as a delicate movement between different forms of storytelling — a work that begins as confessional comedy, is organized like a memoir and is finally imbued with and sustained by the ecstatic energy of prayer.

Carmichael is a man of faith, although, as he says in Rothaniel, coming out as gay has forced him to redefine what that means. Religion, the church and the Bible have, for the most part, always made appearances in his work. In Love at the Store, his first special, directed by Spike Lee, he jokes about Michael Jackson reaching the gates of heaven, presenting St. Peter and the Lord with a conundrum. They are fans of the star, but they are also the moral authorities: Can they let the King of Pop in amid the accusations against him? In 8, directed by Bo Burnham, who also directed Rothaniel, Carmichael presents an absence of faith, performing an extended bit about how he struggles to care and feel strongly about any issues. His family in The Carmichael Show was deeply religious and in his two documentaries, Home Videos and Sermon on the Mount, both directed by the comedian himself, he grapples with the tension between his mother’s faith, his father’s infidelity and his family’s penchant for keeping secrets.

In Rothaniel, Carmichael returns to the subject of secrets. He is older now, much more in command of himself. You can tell just by the smoothness with which he gets on stage, takes a seat and addresses the applauding crowd shadowed by the darkness of the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. His performing and storytelling abilities are sharper, too, allowing him to achieve a new degree of candor.

Carmichael opens with a handful of jokes that show off his signature style of humor. These jabs about the number of affairs in his family history, about his grandmother being a “side-piece,” about the embarrassment around his real name get the crowd going, but they are also a warm-up, allowing Carmichael to ease himself into the space and the crowd. In a recent talk for the New York Public Library, the critic and memoirist Margo Jefferson, whom Carmichael reminds me of, observed how humor factored into her own work. It allowed her to “break through my decorum, my anxiety,” she said, which led her to “other tones, to acknowledge a sort of grief, a sort of self-abnegation.”

Humor serves a similar function in Rothaniel. It allows Carmichael to access a more honest register in this story he has decided to share. In his previous work and in interviews about the special, the comedian has hinted at the suffocating role decorum and politesse play in his family, how they poison conversations and attempts to bridge gaps of understanding. As Carmichael moves from historical affairs to the present, his special transcends the introspective comedy of late and enters the realm of memoir. The contours of the narrative become clearer: This is a story about how revealing another person’s secrets (specifically, telling his mother about his father’s cheating) forced Carmichael to confess his own, and how that admission did not lead to immediate catharsis.

When he comes out, his silences serve as interludes, marking a shift in the story. Carmichael never abandons the humor, but he does lower the volume. The audience becomes louder as they chime in with prompting questions and affirmative statements of love and support. But when Carmichael starts talking about his mother, a central character in many of his stories, I couldn’t help but feel as though he is speaking to someone beyond the people in the audience and viewers at home. The perspective changes, too. Carmichael’s face occupies the left edge of the frame; when he shakes his head in disbelief at his mother’s responses to him, he looks up, away, elsewhere.

Rothaniel, then, starts to feel like a searching prayer, a conversation with God after a long hiatus. Carmichael starts and then abandons thoughts about his mother. He recalls how she told him, in a previous conversation about being gay, that she “can’t go against Jesus.” He follows that by saying he understands that she is trying her best. Prayer isn’t always about request or gratitude. Much like journaling or therapy or talking to a friend, it can help you make sense of the world.

The latter half of Carmichael’s special plays like a communion, a spiritual meeting between him, his family’s past and the unknown terrain of their future. Sitting on the stage, the comedian wears a loneliness familiar to anyone whose survival and self-preservation are at odds with the narratives maintained by their loved ones. To share that experience — with all the relief, confusion and discomfort that come with it — and to trust that those watching will follow is, to me, an extraordinary act of faith.",Lovia Gyarkye,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/critics-notebook-jerrod-carmichael-rothaniel-hbo-1235132121/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JCS_FPP_111T_F_v2-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"The Goldbergs is making it to the decade mark.

The 1980s-set comedy has been renewed for its 10th season on ABC. The renewal arrives a month after star and exec producer Wendi McLendon-Covey signed a new deal to return with producers Sony Pictures Television. The pact, which sources note includes an option for an 11th season, included a sizable pay bump.

With the pickup, The Goldbergs becomes part of an increasingly exclusive club of live-action broadcast comedies to have run for a decade or more. That list includes Friends, Married … With Children, The Jeffersons, Cheers, Frasier (which is also returning with a Paramount+ revival), M*A*S*H, Modern Family, Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and Will & Grace (with that tally including its NBC revival).

Before McLendon-Covey’s new deal, The Goldbergs was strongly on the bubble despite its ranking as the longest-running live-action comedy currently airing on broadcast. The show has had a challenging ninth season and had to write in the death of George Segal (who played the beloved Pops) and is currently working around the departure of star Jeff Garlin.

Garlin, who played patriarch Murray Goldberg, exited in December following an HR investigation that stemmed from multiple complaints over his behavior on the set of the comedy. Sources at the time described the decision as a mutual one between Garlin and Sony. At the time, he was not expected to return for the potential and now-confirmed 10th season.

The Goldbergs had been relatively free of controversy during its run. The series weathered sexual misconduct allegations around former recurring player Bryan Callen, who toplined ABC/Sony’s short-lived 1990s-set spinoff, Schooled. Callen has not appeared on The Goldbergs since the allegations came out in a July 2020 Los Angeles Times report. (Callen denied the allegations.)

The Goldbergs is a semiautobiographical comedy based on the childhood of series creator Adam F. Goldberg. Goldberg served as showrunner until season seven, when he moved his overall deal from Sony to Disney. Alex Barnow and Chris Bishop — who have been with series since its debut — have helmed the show since then and exec produce alongside Doug Robinson and star McLendon-Covey, among others. The cast also includes Sean Giambrone, Troy Gentile, Hayley Orrantia and Sam Lerner.

The Goldbergs joins a roster of returning scripted fare on ABC’s 2022-23 schedule that also includes dramas The Good Doctor, Grey’s Anatomy, The Rookie, Station 19 and comedy breakout Abbott Elementary.

"Sean Penn, Julia Roberts, Dan Stevens and Betty Gilpin attend the ""Gaslit"" New York Premiere at Metropolitan Museum of Art on April 18, 2022 in New York City.

New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art was transformed into the red — or, rather, yellow — carpet on Monday for the world premiere of Starz’s upcoming political thriller Gaslit, starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn.

The series — which also features Dan Stevens and Betty Gilpin — is described as a modern take on Watergate that focuses on the untold stories and forgotten characters of the scandal and centers on Martha Mitchell (Roberts), an Arkansan socialite and wife to John Mitchell (Penn), Richard Nixon’s attorney general. Martha was the first to publicly sound the alarm on the former president’s involvement in the Watergate scandal, which caused his presidency and her personal life to unravel.

Showrunner Robbie Pickering said his interest in Nixon and Watergate began when he was a child, and he saw his mom crying while watching his funeral on TV.

“She said, ‘He was a good man. He was a great man. He was misunderstood. And the liberals did this to him,” Pickering told The Hollywood Reporter. “I was like, ‘I’ve got to know everything about this guy.’ And I started learning about the people around him and this weird culture around him of complicity and cultural bitterness, which we still have today.”

The creator said he took inspiration from the worst qualities of himself and the people he knows and wrote them into the fictionalized version of Gaslit‘s real-life characters.

“The show really explores complicity and why people do horrible things,” he said. “One of the reasons is ambition. So, John Dean (Stevens) is just me writing myself as a young person in Hollywood, writing terrible scripts to impress somebody. John Mitchell, who’s Sean Penn’s character, just feels valued by Nixon. He feels valued by somebody in power, and I think we all know what that’s like to feel — it’s just this weird, seductive feeling.”

Despite the many flaws of the series’ characters, Pickering said creating a show from their perspective gives him hope because it humanized the “pathetic idiots” a bit, adding that some people are prone to be complicit in things that go against who they are.

“It gives me hope because the flip side of that is no matter how flawed we think we are, we all have the capacity to speak up and speak the truth and be heroic,” he says. “Martha was a very flawed person, so really going into her story, it gives you hope for as long as we have villains… as long as we have Putins, we’ll have Zelenskys.”

Because Gaslit is based on actual events and real people, the cast was able to deep dive into researching their onscreen counterparts — who they were, why they did the things they did and how they got to that point in their lives.

“I read Mo Dean’s book, A Woman’s View of Watergate, and I watched hours of the Watergate hearings, where she’s supporting her husband,” said Betty Gilpin, who portrays Maureen “Mo” Dean, wife of Nixon’s White House Counsel John Dean. “There’s so much going on behind her eyes, she’s such an enigma.”

Stevens also used the Watergate hearings to prepare for his role, which piqued his interest because it was “such a key moment” in history and “such an interesting story.”

“There’s a lot of footage of John Dean, sitting, droning on during the hearings, and he’s wheeled out on CNN pretty regularly as their resident corruption expert,” Stevens said.

Gilpin and Stevens star alongside Roberts and Penn, who take on the lead roles in Gaslit. The A-listers wanted to work together for years before finally getting the chance to in the Starz series, Pickering said, adding, “There’s this very deep love between them.”

"First-quarter filming in Los Angeles set a new record to start the year despite an escalating slide in feature film production.

Local film office FilmLA attributed the drop-off to productions being lured by more attractive tax incentives in other jurisdictions and a shortage of soundstage space in the area. According to a new report issued on Tuesday, feature film shoots saw a 25 percent dip below the five year average in the first quarter of 2022.

“It’s doing really well worldwide, but we’ve lost our share of it for years now,” FilmLA president Paul Audley tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Although the pace of production has slowed compared to the end of last year, output is much higher so far than it was in the same period in 2021 when the spread of the Delta variant led to a voluntary filming hiatus that slowed production to just 7,011 shoot days. FilmLA reported that the first quarter of 2022 was the busiest first quarter ever, with 9,832 shoot days. The last time there was such high filming levels from January through March was in 2016.

TV filming, especially drama and reality shows, drove the surge, the film office said. TV production is up 18.7 percent over the same period last year.

But shooting for feature films continued on a steady downward trajectory, according to the report. Despite a slight uptick in production compared to last year, the category remains 25.2 percent below its five year average (FilmLA’s five year averages exclude 2020 when production was suspended in Los Angeles from March to June because of COVID-19).

Productions have turned to shooting outside of California to take advantage of more generous tax incentives. Georgia, for example, offers a 30 percent tax credit with no annual cap on its program. The credit is also transferable, meaning projects can sell it to companies that owe taxes. California remains one of just two states whose credits are largely nontransferable and nonrefundable.

The perception that California’s tax credits are less competitive than other states combined with a shortage of soundstage space in Los Angeles has led to the decline in feature film production, Audley observed. He said, “If you need to shoot a feature that needs six, seven, eight stages, it’s impossible to do that now.”

In July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill (SB144) meant to tackle the soundstage shortfall. It includes a new $150 million credit to incentivize the construction of sets.

Locally filmed projects include Netflix’s Me Time, Home Delivery, Love Me to Death and Rooming with Danger.

Television has become a mainstay of production in Los Angeles, filling the gap that the flight of feature film shoots have left. Audley said the first quarter filming record is at least partially a result of a backlog of productions that pivoted to shooting locally after realizing that going elsewhere would be more costly and troublesome because of COVID-19 restrictions.

“As the COVID era continued, a lot of productions couldn’t leave their base,” Audley said. “They’d have to quarantine for two weeks if they went to other parts of the country. Those productions ended up staying here in LA.”

Production for HBO’s The Flight Attendant moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2021.

FilmLA reported that filming for episodic dramas saw a 8.6 percent increase over the five-year average, owing to a significant demand for content on streaming platforms. TV dramas that filmed locally include FX’s American Horror Stories, Apple TV+’s Little America, HBO’s Perry Mason, ABC’s Promised Land and CBS’ S.W.A.T.

Tax incentives are a significant driver of local TV dramas choosing to shoot in Los Angeles. Shows receiving tax credits generated 499 shoot days for the quarter, representing 39 percent of all activity in the category.

California bolstered in July the Film & Television Tax Credit program with an additional $180 million in incentives on top of the $330 million already earmarked for the industry. Part of the program is geared specifically toward incentivizing TV productions to relocate to California.

As in recent quarters, TV reality production continued to significantly escalate. Filming for the category increased 71.7 percent, with 2,600 shoot days to start the year. Projects that filmed locally include Basketball Wives, Celebrity IOU, Family or Fiancé and People Magazine Investigates.

“Seeing cycles in production for all of these [categories] is not unusual,” Audley said. “The explosion of reality tv has to do with covid era where they could do those productions with not a lot of cast and crew and not have a lot of issues.”",Winston Cho,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-feature-shoot-days-decline-but-overall-filming-hits-record-1235132041/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gettyimages-1218653953.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"[The following interview contains spoilers for Better Call Saul’s two-episode premiere.]

The walls are closing in on Michael Mando’s Ignacio “Nacho” Varga.

In the long awaited final season premiere of Better Call Saul, Ignacio, the reluctant lieutenant to the Salamanca’s drug-dealing operation, narrowly escaped a standoff with the Salamanca cousins (Daniel and Luis Moncada), as Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) set him up to be the fall guy for the massacre at Lalo Salamanca’s (Tony Dalton) compound. Die-hard fans of the Breaking Bad universe have speculated about this storyline since it was first teased nearly 13 years ago during Saul Goodman’s Breaking Bad introduction, “Better Call Saul.”

With the Salamancas still hot on his heels, Mando makes it clear that Ignacio’s quest to protect himself and his father becomes even more formidable.

“As the story progresses, we’ll get to see what he’s really made of and how far he’s willing to go to protect his father,” Mando tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Towards the end of the Vince Gilligan-helmed second episode, Ignacio made a last-ditch call for help to Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Fring’s fixer. The two have shared a bond since Mike first helped Ignacio with his ever-increasing Salamanca problem in Better Call Saul season two’s “Gloves Off.”

“There’s this unspoken virtue between them and an honor among thieves. They respect innocent lives, which the Salamancas don’t. They honor their word, which the Salamancas don’t. And Gus doesn’t either,” Mando says.

In a recent conversation with THR, Mando also recalls a moment on set with Gilligan where they both took turns bashing a wall-mounted air conditioning unit.

On April 26th, 2009, Breaking Bad viewers first heard the name Ignacio as Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) blamed him for something he presumably did to Lalo (Tony Dalton). And now, nearly 13 years later, we’re finally seeing that fabled story unfold. How rewarding has this climactic moment been for you?

It’s been unbelievable. I don’t know what I’ve done to be so lucky. You can work really hard and have a lot of talent, but for the stars to align the way they have in my career, it fills me up with a sense of tremendous gratitude, humility and responsibility.

There are numerous parallels between Ignacio and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and the Vince Gilligan-directed episode two, “Carrot and Stick,” helps make these first few episodes of Better Call Saul feel like Ignacio’s version of Jesse’s story in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. So what do you make of Ignacio’s own attempt to do right in the end and hopefully free himself?

To play a character who’s breaking good when the full current of the scripts are breaking bad, it positions you with tremendous pressure, but it’s so rewarding despite the pain, frustration and torment of the character. Because deep down, at its core, you know you’re doing the right thing. You’re standing up for virtue, and in a show about morality, you’re one of the only characters, if not the only character, who’s really going from dark to light. So it’s such a heroic and fulfilling place to be, and I feel very grateful that they’ve given me that responsibility.

Ignacio is running for his life in these early episodes, and it looks especially painful since he’s wearing boots in the process. Did you take on most of that work?

(Laughs.) I did every stunt in all those episodes except for two: the jumping out of the building and the moment of collision with the trucks. Other than that, I did everything else myself. And it was just an incredible order that they’ve asked me to deliver this season. First of all, it’s incredibly physical. It’s excruciatingly emotional, and psychologically, you’re just hitting every note on the piano. It was just such an amazing rollercoaster ride.

Your shoulder was really leaning into that air conditioning unit.

Absolutely! At one point, Vince yelled, “Cut!” and then he came out and started doing it himself. So it was awesome.

What do you remember about filming the shootout and standoff with Don Eladio’s (Steven Bauer) sicarios and the Salamanca cousins?

I remember learning a tremendous amount from Vince. He thinks in cinematic moments. He is diligent with homework, but he’s also really quick to improvise. In some of the crucial moments in that epic stakeout, he had me play them in almost two completely opposite ways, and he would adjust storytelling elements very slightly as we went along. So it was wonderful to learn from a master. That whole motel sequence was shot on two locations. We shot at the actual parking lot of the motel, but all the interior scenes were shot in the studio.

Ignacio was quite antsy in that motel room. He could sense that something wasn’t right before he figured it out definitively. What notes were you given during that sequence?

Vince said two things about Nacho that stuck with me. He said, “This is a samurai without a master.” Like a rōnin. And he also said that he’s a tiger in a cage or a lion in a cage. I can’t remember which of the two it was. (Laughs.) But I think that was a really good stepping stone for me to get into the mindset of this character. I knew that Vince wanted to pan in that [motel room] shot, and so I asked him why. And his answer is why Vince is such a genius. He said frankly, “They built a wonderful set, and I want to show it.” And that, to me, is the magic of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Every department gets its rightful due. We’re all working on this together, and that was such a beautiful thing to hear and to learn.

Ignacio doesn’t know that Mike is sticking his neck out for him and his father. He also doesn’t know that Mike is doing it in part to prevent another father and son ending up like him and his murdered son, Matty. Does Ignacio sense that Mike was a father? Is that why he issued this cry for help in the first place?

There’s a profound connection between Mike and Nacho that is sort of unspoken. In many ways, they are cut from the same cloth, and Nacho looks at Mike as a mirror of his own father in the cartel world. There’s this unspoken virtue between them and an honor among thieves. They respect innocent lives, which the Salamancas don’t. They honor their word, which the Salamancas don’t. And Gus doesn’t either. So there’s definitely a profound, subtextual connection between the two, and maybe in the subconscious of it all, there’s a feeling that there’s a situation between Mike and Nacho. When Mike sent Tuco [Raymond Cruz] to jail, Nacho had a profound sadness to see Mike being beaten up like that. He really cared for him and asked him, “Why are you punishing yourself for people who would kill and have killed innocent people without even thinking about it?”

When he’s alone with his thoughts, does Ignacio ever regret going after Tuco? Things have spiraled ever since as Hector (Mark Margolis), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) entered into his orbit.

He had no choice with Tuco. He started doing a lot of meth again, and that’s when he kills people for no logical reason. So Nacho was immediately put in a predicament where these guys weren’t going to let him walk. And so he had no choice because he knew that Tuco was going to end up killing him one way or another. In season two, Nacho made that really clear to Mike when he explained the situation with Dog Paulson. Tuco shot this guy’s head off, and he almost killed Ignacio doing it. Pieces of this guy’s skull are still lodged in Ignacio’s chest. So it’s a tragic story about a man who gets caught up at a young age with the wrong crowd, and because of his abilities, they won’t let him go. He becomes too valuable.

What can you say about the dangerous road ahead as Ignacio fights for his life and the life of his father (Juan Carlos Cantu)?

These characters are iconic, and each character represents something. I think Ignacio is the prodigal son, and he represents redemption, sacrifice and love. So as the story progresses, we’ll get to see what he’s really made of and how far he’s willing to go to protect his father.

No sign of renewed peace talks - Ukrainian official

KYIV/KHARKIV, April 19 (Reuters) - Russia was intensifying its attack on Ukraine's east on Tuesday as it seized a frontline city and sought a decisive victory in Mariupol, prompting Western governments to pledge more arms and sanctions.

Thousands of Russian troops backed by artillery and rocket barrages were advancing in what Ukrainian officials called the Battle of the Donbas.

Russia's nearly eight-week-long invasion has taken longer than many expected while still failing to capture any of the biggest cities, forcing Moscow to refocus in and around separatist regions.

The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has, however, seen nearly 5 million people flee abroad and reduced cities to rubble as the incursion drags on.

Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant, the main remaining stronghold in Mariupol, with bunker-buster bombs, a Ukrainian presidential adviser said late on Tuesday. Reuters could not verify the details.

""The world watches the murder of children online and remains silent,"" adviser Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

After an earlier ultimatum to surrender lapsed and as midnight approached, Russia's defence ministry said not a single Ukrainian soldier had laid down their weapons and renewed the proposal. Ukrainian commanders at Azovstal have vowed not to surrender.

""Russia's armed forces, based purely on humanitarian principles, again propose that the fighters of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries cease their military operations from 1400 Moscow time on 20th April and lay down arms,"" the Russian Defence Ministry said.

The United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany pledged more support to Ukraine.

""We will continue to provide them more ammunition, as we will provide them more military assistance,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said, adding that new sanctions were being prepared.

""It is unfair that Ukraine still has to ask for (weapons) which have been sitting for years in the storage depots of our partners"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a four-day humanitarian pause in the fighting this coming weekend, when Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter, to allow civilians to escape and humanitarian aid to be delivered.

Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.

CITY CAPTURED

Ukraine said the new assault had resulted in the capture of Kreminna, an administrative centre of 18,000 people in Luhansk, one of the two Donbas provinces.

Russian forces were attacking ""on all sides"", authorities were trying to evacuate civilians and it was impossible to tally the civilian dead, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed that ""another stage of this operation is beginning"".

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia was ""methodically"" carrying out its plan to ""liberate"" Donetsk and Luhansk, provinces which Moscow demands Kyiv cede fully to Russian-backed separatists.

Driven back by Ukrainian forces in March from an assault on Kyiv in the north, Russia has instead poured troops into the east for the Donbas offensive. It has also made long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital.

Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces had tried to break through Ukrainian defences ""along almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions"".

The coal- and steel-producing Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin used proxies to set up separatist ""people's republics"" in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Moscow now says its aim is to capture the full provinces on the separatists' behalf. Ukraine has a large force defending northern parts of the Donbas and military experts say Russia aims to cut them off or surround them.

But Russia still needs to keep its troops supplied across miles of hostile territory. Ukraine has counter-attacked near Kharkiv in the rear of Russia's advance, apparently aiming to cut off supply lines.

SHELL-SHOCKED RESIDENTS

In Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, about 120 civilians living next to the sprawling steel plant left via humanitarian corridors, the Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, quoting Russian state TV.

Mariupol has been besieged since the war's early days. Tens of thousands of residents have been trapped with no access to food or water and bodies litter the streets. Ukraine believes more than 20,000 civilians have died there.

Russia has denied targeting civilians in its invasion of Ukraine and says, without evidence, that signs of atrocities were staged.

Capturing Mariupol would link pro-Russian separatist territory with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.

In Russian-held districts reached by Reuters, shell-shocked residents cooked on open fires outside their damaged homes.

""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters.

Kyiv and Moscow have not held face-to-face talks since March 29. Each side blames the other for their breakdown.

""It is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be possible because the Russians are seriously betting on the so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said.

Shells and rockets also hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, local officials said, wrecking apartment blocks and other buildings. Four people were killed and 14 wounded, they said.

Reuters journalists saw the bodies of three people apparently killed by shrapnel lying on the pavement.

Summary Some civilians say they had no choice but to flee to Russia

Ukraine human rights ombudswoman says 33,000 forcibly deported

Ukrainians often sent deep into Russia, far from border

Moscow says it is providing humanitarian aid

KYIV, April 19 (Reuters) - Mila Panchenko found herself on a station platform in southwest Russia after lack of food and water forced her to hand herself over to pro-Russian forces to escape the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

At the station in Taganrog, a port on the Sea of Azov, she was put on a train along with around 200 other Ukrainians and told they were being transported to another part of Russia's Rostov region, which borders Ukraine.

But when the train arrived at its destination, the 53-year-old found herself in Tula province in central Russia, in the town of Suvorov, some 1,000 km (621 miles) away.

""There were a lot of police. The station was sealed off so no Russian civilians could approach us,"" Panchenko said, adding that there were crowds to greet them but the son of a friend from Tula - who she did not identify - was not allowed in. ""We were met cheerfully, with cookies.""

In addition to Panchenko, Reuters spoke to another Ukrainian woman - Natalia Bil-Maer - who escaped Mariupol last month, as well as the relatives of two other refugees.

They painted a picture of some civilians in Mariupol having no choice but to flee from the besieged city to Russia, a journey that involved repeated searches and questioning by pro-Russian forces before being transported often far from Ukraine's border.

Reuters was unable to verify their stories independently.

The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment about the independent accounts provided to Reuters by Panchenko and Bil-Maer of Ukrainians being sent to distant parts of Russia without any choice.

Moscow has denied intentionally targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Panchenko said she and the other Ukrainians on the train were taken by Russian authorities to a sanatorium in the Tula region called Krainka. She was given a room with a small fridge, a television and two single beds. Laid on a table was traditional gingerbread, sweet biscuits, water and iced tea.

The Krainka resort did not respond to a request for comment on its role in sheltering the Ukrainians.

After arriving at the sanatorium, Panchenko - the duty manager of a cistern factory before the war and a member of the local council - said she was fingerprinted, photographed and questioned in front of a prosecutor, whom Reuters was unable to identify.

Panchenko - who speaks Russian and Ukrainian - was asked whether the suppression of the Russian language in Ukraine had worsened since 2014, she said.

In that year, Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula while two breakaway regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- declared themselves people's republics with Moscow's backing.

One of Russia's justifications for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is to protect Russian speakers from what Moscow brands aggression from Ukrainian nationalists. Ukraine has denied this.

""I only said that I could speak Ukrainian and that I loved it ... I said I hadn't witnessed any suppression of Russian.""

FORCED DEPORTATIONS

Liudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudswoman for human rights, said last week that Russia had taken 134,000 people from Mariupol and that 33,000 of those were forcibly deported. Reuters was unable to determine the accuracy of those statistics.

Rachel Denber, deputy director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, said her organisation had documented at least one instance where there was ""no question that it would be considered a forced transfer"" - which she defined as ""being forced to go to the side that has invaded your country.""

The 1949 Geneva Conventions, which defined legal standards for humanitarian treatment in conflict, prohibit the mass forcible transfer of civilians during an international conflict to the territory of the occupying power, classifying it as a war crime.

Russia says it is offering humanitarian aid to those wanting to leave Mariupol. A Russian government resolution, published on March 12 on its website, listed the whereabouts of 95,909 people across Russia who had left Ukraine and the two breakaway republics.

A month later, on April 14, Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev said that 138,014 civilians had been rescued by Russian forces just from Mariupol, as the fighting intensified.

Panchenko said she fled Mariupol on March 17 when Chechen troops seized the building on the left bank of the Kalmius river where she and dozens of other civilians had been sheltering in a basement.

""They said that we had to evacuate because they wanted to set up their headquarters there,"" Panchenko said by telephone from Brescia, in northern Italy, where she is now living, having left Russia.

With scant supplies of food and water, Panchenko said she had no choice but to get into the cars offered by the Chechen soldiers to take them to Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk.

They were transported by car and then bus to the village of Bezimenne, where police from the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have set up processing facilities, Panchenko said. They were fingerprinted and questioned by separatist police.

Spokespeople for the DPR and the Chechen authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

""We were asked if we had any connection with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, if we knew anyone from the Azov Battalion,"" she said, referring to a Ukrainian National Guard unit that Moscow has accused of targeting Russian speakers. ""We weren't on any lists, so they put us on a bus again and took us to Taganrog train station.""

TRAINS SENT ACROSS RUSSIA

On March 22, Bil-Maer fled the basement of a relative's apartment block with her husband and two children - aged 6 and 7 - as the Russian assault drew closer. They had planned to go to the nearby coastal town of Berdiansk, to the west, but their route was blocked by shelling.

""We had only one way left to go because that part of town was controlled by Russian soldiers ... So they transported us and we were deported to Russia.""

As they were taken through Russian-controlled territory, Bil-Maer said Ukrainians were repeatedly questioned and men were asked to strip, as Russian forces searched for combatants.

But by March 23 she found herself on Russian soil and was taken to Taganrog station.

""In Taganrog, there were a lot of nice words said to us: “We've saved you. We'll feed you”,"" said Bil-Maer, who saw trains headed to Tambov and Vladimir in central Russia. ""It was clear that every train was going to a different place.""

As soon as Bil-Maer could use her phone, she called an aunt in Russia's Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov from east Ukraine, and she came to pick up the family.

But, once in her aunt’s home, Bil-Maer said she was reluctant to go outside because she was tired of being told by strangers that the Russian bombing was Ukraine's fault for attacking Russian-speakers. She said many Russians echoed the Kremlin’s position - reproduced in the media - that civilian casualties in the conflict were caused by Ukraine’s own armed forces to discredit Moscow.

Bil-Maer quickly fled to Georgia with her husband and children.

She does not know how she will return home: she is struggling to get help from the Ukrainian embassy and only has her internal passport with her. Her husband also left the country with her illegally when it was banned because he was of fighting age.

Ukraine foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Ukraine had to close its diplomatic missions in Russia for security reasons but embassies in the neighboring countries would provide consular assistance to Ukrainians deported to Russia to enable them to return home, including temporary travel documents.

After 10 days at the Krainka resort, Panchenko said she persuaded the Russians to allow her to leave for Nizhny Novgorod, a city on the Volga river east of Moscow, to stay with the family of an elderly neighbor from Mariupol who had fled with her.

Once outside the resort, Panchenko and her neighbor, who she identified as Zhan, went instead to Moscow and then to the Baltic States. Panchenko found her way eventually to Italy.

""But my plan is to make some money and return to my home Mariupol, if it stays Ukrainian,"" she said. ""I want to come back to Ukraine very much.""

DYMER, Ukraine, April 19 (Reuters) - Volodymyr Khropun and Yulia Ivannikova-Katsemon say they were helping people flee villages on the front line in northern Ukraine when they were detained by Russian soldiers over two days in March.

Both said they were then held with around 40 other captives on the concrete floor of a nearby factory, their hands bound. Nearly a week later they were transferred in a military truck to Belarus, and on to detention centres in Russia, they said.

Khropun, an electrical engineer, and Ivannikova-Katsemon, an emergency services dispatcher, were freed with 24 others in a prisoner exchange on April 9.

Standing outside the dank windowless room where they say they were kept in the formerly occupied village of Dymer, north of the capital, Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon have returned to describe their three weeks in Russian custody, which they said included being beaten. Ivannikova-Katsemon also said she was tasered.

Both said they were working as volunteers for the local Red Cross when they were taken prisoner, interrogated and accused of passing information on the activity of Russian forces to the other side, which they deny.

The Ukrainian Red Cross confirmed they were both volunteers. They were both reported as missing or illegally detained civilians by the Euromaidan SOS initiative of Ukrainian human rights group The Center for Civil Liberties as of March 26.

Reuters was not able to independently verify all the details of their stories. The Kremlin and Russia's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment about their accounts.

Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon's detailed narratives shed more light on the mistreatment Ukraine alleges some of its citizens and soldiers have faced in Russian captivity since the start of the war. Their journey also shows one way Russia has transferred some of the hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners it says it holds to Russian territory.

Since the start of the war on Feb. 24, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the Geneva Conventions that cover the protection of civilians during war and the treatment of prisoners of war.

In March, Russia's human rights ombudswoman said she had heard about cases of ""cruel and inhuman treatment"" of Russian POWs in Ukraine.

This month Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman said returning POWs had described mistreatment while in Russian captivity that included being kept in basements, denied food and made to take off their clothes. read more

Authorities from both sides have repeatedly said they abide by international humanitarian law in terms of treatment of prisoners.

Speaking in the factory in Dymer, Khropun described what happened when he was first detained by Russian forces, after driving evacuees through a checkpoint on March 18.

""They arrested me, closed my eyes - as in, they pulled a hat over my eyes, bound it on with scotch tape - and then wrapped my hands in tape, like a terrorist. Then I was transferred here,"" said Khropun, 44.

He and Ivannikova-Katsemon had both been regularly crossing the front line to help locals escape the fighting around villages north of Kyiv. Ivannikova-Katsemon, 37, was detained similarly the next day, she said.

""There was always hope with God that I would return (home),"" said Ivannikova-Katsemon, who has children, occasionally pausing to steady her voice or hold back tears. ""The hard thing was not being able to tell family and friends that I was alive and in captivity.""

'NIGHTMARE COME TO LIFE'

The two said they were held in an unheated room at the small factory in Dymer, huddled on thin mattresses and scraps of cardboard. Around 40 detainees were crammed into the space, sharing a plastic pot for a toilet.

""It was like a nightmare come to life,"" Khropun said, speaking to Reuters back in the room where he was held.

He pointed to the dirty mattress he shared with several others. The floor was littered with trash, empty boxes of Russian army rations, zip ties and loops of tape that they said had bound people's hands.

Ivannikova-Katsemon described how she was able to slightly loosen the binding around her wrists with a safety pin that she kept hold of throughout her time in captivity by hiding it inside her hair tie.

The Russians brought food once or twice a day, mostly army crackers and the occasional pot of cooked food. There were only two plastic spoons so some people ate with their hands, others with scraps of paper, said Khropun.

One of the spoons was still jabbed into a pot that was half-full of what looked like rotting cabbage stew.

A bullet hole was visible in the concrete ceiling of the room. One of the guards had fired into the air to spook them, they said.

BELARUS AND RUSSIA

After nearly a week, Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon said that they and around 14 other detainees were loaded onto a military truck. They weren't told where they were going, but the stop-start journey through Belarus would eventually take them to official detention centres in Russia.

In Belarus, they said they were interrogated by the Russian military. They each received a document that included their photo, date of birth, height, hair colour and other identifying details that designated them as ""a person who has shown opposition to the special military operation"" - Russia's term for its war in Ukraine.

They showed Reuters copies of the documents, titled 'Certificate of Identity' and issued by the Russian armed forces.

""The first stage was being stripped naked, photographed, the noting of scars, I have a few. Then the pouring of water (on me) and a beating,"" Ivannikova-Katsemon said. The document she received lists her scars in a section called ""Other features"".

Once in Russia, the two said they passed through several different detention centres. At one point, Ivannikova-Katsemon said she was told she would be sent to work in a timber camp in Russia's far east.

""I don't know the place, they just said: Siberia,"" she recalled.

Khropun said he faced multiple interrogations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, sometimes being forced to kneel for long periods in cold rooms or beaten on his knees or ribs.

He said younger prisoners were singled out for especially tough beatings by guards, who also shaved the captives' heads and beards, sometimes leaving a tuft or half a moustache as a form of humiliation.

He said he tried to keep up the morale of his fellow detainees, who he said were also Ukrainian civilians. ""I’d say, 'guys – we will all get home 100%. There is just one small question: when?'""

RETURN HOME

On April 8, the two said they were given back the clothes they were wearing when first detained, still dirty from the days spent on the factory floor.

In handcuffs, they were taken by plane to Crimea from where they were driven by truck to Ukraine-controlled territory on April 9.

They said they had been selected for a prisoner swap, but did not know why they were picked over others.

After around three weeks in captivity, they were home.

""Of course there was the sense of joy, but it was somehow hard to fully comprehend,"" said Khropun.

Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon said they were the only ones to be exchanged from the group of detainees who were sent from Dymer to Russia. They described their fears for the others they believe are still being held in Russia.

The Ukrainian authorities have confirmed that 26 prisoners were swapped with Russia on April 9, but have not named them all. The office of deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating the swaps, did not respond to a request for comment about the release of Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon.

On April 11, Vereshchuk said in total some 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were being held in Russia and by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. read more

Ukraine held around 600 Russian military prisoners of war and no civilians as of April 4, according to Vereshchuk.

Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian POWs in Russia.

Ivannikova-Katsemon said she wears a medical corset and takes medicine to manage the pain she feels as a result of her treatment in captivity.

""But these monsters, who supposedly call themselves liberators, did not break me,"" she said, standing in the spring sunshine outside the Dymer factory.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The leaders of the United States, Britain and Canada pledged on Tuesday to send more artillery weaponry to Ukraine in the face of an all-out Russian assault on that country's East.

U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted after they and other allied leaders took part in a secure video call as the Russian invasion reached a new phase.

Biden is expected to announce in coming days another military aid package for Ukraine about the same size as the $800 million one announced last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

If the aid package is as large as expected, it would bring total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February to well over $3 billion. read more

Asked by reporters during a visit to New Hampshire if the United States would be sending more artillery to Ukraine, Biden replied yes.

In London, Johnson told lawmakers: ""This will become an artillery conflict, they need support with more artillery, that is what we will be giving them ... in addition to many other forms of support.""

Trudeau said Canada would be sending heavy artillery and promised to provide more details.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Air Force One the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to providing Ukraine security and economic and humanitarian assistance.

""We will continue to provide them more ammunition, as we will provide them more military assistance,"" Psaki said. She said the United States was preparing another round of sanctions to impose on Moscow.

In their 90-minute video call, Biden and the allies discussed their diplomatic engagements and coordinated efforts to further impose ""severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable,"" Psaki said.

They are to coordinate through the G7, the European Union and NATO, she said.

Russia seized its first town in eastern Ukraine as part of a fresh assault that Ukraine has described as the Battle of the Donbas aimed at taking two provinces. read more

The United States sees Russia carrying out a ""prelude"" to larger offensive operations in the eastern part of its neighboring country, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday. read more

Biden's video call from the White House Situation Room began at 9:57 a.m. EDT (1357 GMT) and ended at 11:21 a.m. EDT (1521 GMT), with Biden speaking from the White House Situation Room.

Others on the call included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as well as the leaders of Italy, Japan and Poland.

A French presidential adviser said the allies had discussed how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine after the war if it is not part of NATO and its automatic defense mechanism known as Article 5.

""Our country is ready to provide security guarantees,"" the French official said. ""It would be military supplies so that it can deal with a new attack or, possibly, guarantees that would see us get involved if Ukraine is attacked in a way where we could assess how to assist it.""

These guarantees would look more like the defense clause the European Union currently has among its members, the French official said, rather than a defense mechanism similar to NATO's Article 5, which triggers automatic military support if a member is attacked.

Allies also discussed the need to persuade non-EU, non-G7 countries to treat the war in Ukraine as an issue that concerns world peace and not just Europe or the West, the French official said.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

April 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) board directors can lean on concerns about the fate of the social media platform under Elon Musk to rebuff him, but if they decide to explore a sale, price will override all other considerations, corporate governance experts said.

The San Francisco-based company received a $43 billion ""best and final"" offer from Musk last week, which it is still reviewing. Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), has said he wants to make Twitter an ""arena for free speech,"" cheering Twitter's critics who complain about censorship and alarming those worried about hate speech and bullying. read more

Twitter's board is expected to reject Musk's bid as too low by April 28, when it is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, people familiar with the matter have said. Even if Twitter's bankers declared the offer was fair, the company's board directors have wide latitude to reject it if they thought the platform was better off with its current content strategy, corporate governance lawyers and professors said. read more

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

This would change, however, if, Twitter's board decided to explore a sale, either because it received more offers or it decided to solicit acquisition bids, these experts said.

Corporate law in Delaware, where Twitter is incorporated, dictates that once a company launches a sale process, securing the most lucrative deal for shareholders becomes the overarching consideration. Board directors are not allowed to factor in what would happen to the company in their deliberations if existing shareholders will cash out.

""All these culture and discourse and democracy considerations fall by wayside because that’s not going to benefit shareholders anymore,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School.

Twitter and Musk spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As it stands, board directors legally have wide discretion on how to handle Musk's bid because it was unsolicited. The directors can refuse to engage with Musk if they believe the company's content policies and culture better serve the long-term interests of its investors, said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.

""If they think Musk will turn Twitter into a free-speech hellscape, that is sufficient justification,"" Quinn said.

Whether Twitter will decide to explore a sale will likely hinge on whether it receives attractive and credible offers in the coming days.

Private equity firm Thoma Bravo LP contacted Twitter last week to express interest in putting together an offer that would challenge Musk, but there is no certainty that such a bid will materialize, sources told Reuters. Sources have also said that other buyout firms have since contacted Twitter to register their acquisition interest. read more

NO FOUNDER AROUND TO PROTECT IT

Unlike its peers Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Twitter is not controlled by founders with supervoting shares who can shoot down a deal even if viable and lucrative offers are on the table. Twitter adopted a poison pill last week to prevent Musk, who has amassed a stake in the company of more than 9%, from raising his stake to more than 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. read more

Adding to its vulnerability, Twitter has not set up a structure governing the moderation of its platform that would survive under new ownership. It has not, for example, set up a formal process for an independent arbiter to review its decisions, though its users can appeal to the company if their account is locked or suspended.

Meta, on the other hand, has set up an external Oversight Board, which allows users to appeal Facebook's decisions to remove or leave up certain content. The Oversight Board’s decisions are binding.

Twitter could face backlash from some of its shareholders if it does not explore a sale, including from Musk, who has tweeted that he wants the company's shareholders to have a say irrespective of what its board thinks. Musk could challenge the board in the company's 2023 annual meeting of shareholders by putting forward his own slate of nominees, and, if successful, force the company to explore a sale.

Unless Twitter decides to explore a sale, it can continue to look out for the interests of stakeholders beyond shareholders, such as its users and employees, corporate governance experts say.

""You are explicitly allowed to point to non-shareholder constituencies as your rationale for wanting to beat back the takeover,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.

April 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) co-founder Jack Dorsey took aim at the social media company's board in a series of tweets late on Monday as it weighs Elon Musk's $43 billion takeover offer.

Dorsey, who is also a Twitter board member, added to the chatter on the micro-blogging platform last week when he said that Twitter's board has ""consistently been the dysfunction of the company.""

In response a tweet on Monday asking him why he did not ""do anything about it"" when he was the CEO of Twitter, Dorsey expressed frustration at his limited ability to speak freely.

""So much to say … but nothing that can be said,"" Dorsey tweeted.

Dorsey's tweets come after two weeks of upheaval at the social media company that started with Musk disclosing a 9.2% stake and then making a buyout offer. On Friday, the board adopted a ""poison pill"" to limit Musk's ability to raise his stake in the company. read more

""I really wish I could break through all the abstraction here and answer you but alas and woe,"" Dorsey tweeted in reply to another thread urging him to share his thoughts.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Musk has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's strategies and its board. He tweeted on Monday that the salary of Twitter's board members would be $0 if his bid succeeds, resulting in $3 million being saved every year.

Other potential buyers, including private equity firm Thoma Bravo, are also considering buyout bids for Twitter, according to reports. read more

Dorsey continues to serve as the CEO of Square and holds a seat on Twitter's board. His term is due to expire in May at the company's upcoming annual meeting.

NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The best buyer for Twitter (TWTR.N) may be nobody. The social network on Friday enacted a “poison pill” read more , temporarily blocking Elon Musk’s $41 billion takeover bid, but putting it in play. As Twitter learned in 2016 when multiple suitors walked away, closing a deal can be harder.

Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share, which is non-binding and lacks financing, is easy for Twitter to dismiss. It also shows the steep financial hill buyers will have to climb. The Tesla (TSLA.O) boss would earn an unattractive return of about 1% on his investment by 2024, according to a Breakingviews analysis read more using estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Reducing the board’s salaries to zero, as Musk claimed in a tweet on Monday, barely changes that calculation. Besides, the board would probably demand a higher premium before recommending a deal.

Twitter’s meager cash flow makes it hard for financial buyers like Thoma Bravo to finance a takeover with lots of debt. Private equity investors could join forces with Musk, who owns more than 9% of the company. But that would mean playing junior partner to the entrepreneur, whose ideas for Twitter appear to include upending its advertising business.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O) or Alphabet (GOOGL.O) might see an opportunity to squeeze more advertising revenue out of Twitter’s community of devoted users. But regulators in America and Europe read more have made it clear they will oppose any deals that make technology giants even more powerful.

Salesforce.com (CRM.N) wanted to buy Twitter in 2016, when the social network was roughly half its current size, but abandoned the effort after its stock fell on the news. Shareholders in the $188 billion software group are unlikely to be more receptive now. Brand-conscious buyers, meanwhile, will be wary. Former Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Bob Iger said he walked away in 2016 because of the “nastiness” on Twitter’s platform. Attempts to reduce negativity and disinformation may please advertisers but put off users like Musk, who worry it restricts free speech.

Musk’s interest shows that a lack of obvious financial logic may not prevent a deal. A more likely outcome, however, might be a partial investment, perhaps by a private equity firm. Silver Lake in 2020 invested $1 billion in Twitter through a convertible note, helping to finance a share buyback to get activist Elliott Management onside. The company could use a similar deal to buy Musk out of his stake. It would be a reminder that Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators.

"Official campaign posters of French President and centrist LREM party candidate for re-election Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, leader of French far-right National Rally (Rassemblement National) party, are displayed at France Affichage Plus dispatch hub in Mitry-Mory, outside Paris, France, March 22, 2022.

PARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's lead in voting intention polls widened on Tuesday but his prime minister said a Macron win in Sunday's presidential runoff vote was not guaranteed, as far-right challenger Marine Le Pen accused him of fear-mongering.

Three polls for the second-round runoff put Macron at the highest level since before the first round, with an average score of 55.83%, up more than a point from Friday and more than three points from an average of five polls before the first round.

Prime Minister Jean Castex, however, said it was too early to claim victory.

""The game is not done and dusted,"" Castex said on France Inter radio.

An Ipsos poll saw Macron winning 56.5% of the vote, up half a point from Friday and 3.5 points from April 8, two days before the vote in which Macron and Le Pen qualified for the second round.

Polls by Opinionway and Ifop, at 56% and 55% respectively, also showed Macron with his highest share of voting intentions since before the first-round vote on April 10.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio that Le Pen would ""hand France's sovereignty to Vladimir Putin and to Russia"" if she was elected.

Le Pen has in the past voiced admiration for the Russian president and says she would pull France out of NATO's integrated military command.

Le Maire said a Le Pen victory would mean the end of French sovereignty, an alliance with Putin, a lack of NATO protection and severed ties with Germany.

In a campaign clip, Le Pen accused Macron and his allies of frightening citizens into voting against her.

""Macron, aware of his sombre prospects of winning a second term, has turned to ... blackmail by fear. Fear is the president's only remaining argument,"" she said.

Centrist Macron and Le Pen are seeking to attract voters who backed far-left leader Jean Luc Melenchon, after he came third in the first round with about 22% of the vote.

Melenchon's party has not given any voting instructions for the runoff but Melenchon has called on his followers not to vote for Le Pen. read more

In his first televised interview since the first round, Melenchon reiterated the call.

""You will make a colossal mistake if you vote for Mrs Le Pen. I don't tell you to vote for Macron, search inside your heads what's best, but don't do this,"" he told BFM TV.

Melenchon added that he would now focus on the legislative election this summer in order to form a left-wing majority and become the country's Prime Minister.

""I call on the French to elect me Prime Minister,"" Melenchon said, adding that he would be prepared to work with both Macron and Le Pen as presidents and that he had no clear preference between the two.

The Prime Minister in France, who is appointed by the president, has to control a majority in the National Assembly.

According to an Elabe poll also published on Tuesday, 42% of Melenchon's voters are now ready to give their vote to Macron, up 7% from last week.

April 19 (Reuters) - Global streaming giant Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) on Tuesday reported losing subscribers for the first time in more than a decade and predicted more contraction in the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has been a reliable growth engine for investors.

The company's stock plunged 23% in after-market trading, erasing $30 billion in market value.

Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its forecast of adding 2.5 million subscribers. Its decision in early March to suspend service in Russia after it invaded Ukraine resulted in the loss of 700,000 members.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The company's poor results pummeled other video streaming-related stocks, with Roku (ROKU.O) dropping over 6%, Walt Disney (DIS.N) falling 3% and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) down 2%.

Netflix, which currently has 221.6 million subscribers, last reported a loss in customers in October 2011.

The company offered a gloomy prediction for the spring quarter, forecasting it would lose 2 million subscribers, despite the return of such hotly anticipated series as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark"" and the debut of the film ""The Grey Man,"" starring Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling. Wall Street targeted 227 million for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

First-quarter revenue grew 10% to $7.87 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecasts of $7.93 billion. It reported per-share net earnings of $3.53, beating the Wall Street consensus of $2.89.

""The large number of households sharing accounts -- combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently,"" Netflix said, explaining the difficulties of signing up new customers.

In addition to the paying households, Netflix is being watched by an additional 100 million households that it said were sharing accounts, including 30 million in the United States and Canada. As penetration has increased, the number of shared accounts has become a bigger problem.

The world's dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals like Amazon.com (AMZN.O), traditional media companies such as the Walt Disney and the newly formed Warner Bros Discovery and cash-flush newcomers like Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Streaming services spent $50 billion on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That's a 50% increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signaling the quick escalation of the so-called ""streaming wars.""

Netflix noted that despite the intensifying competition, its share of TV viewing in the United States has held steady according to Nielsen, a mark of subscriber satisfaction and retention.

""We want to grow that share faster,"" the company said.

As growth slows in mature markets like the United States, Netflix is increasingly focused on other parts of the world and investing in local language content.

""While hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world's broadband homes don't yet -- representing huge future growth potential,"" the company said in a statement.

Netflix has been able to increase subscription prices in the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, to fund content production and growth in other parts of the world, such as Asia, noted Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. However, subscription prices in these growth markets are lower.

Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan warned that the uncertain global economy ""is apt to emerge as an albatross"" for member growth and Netflix's ability to continue raising prices as competition intensifies.

Streaming services are not the only form of entertainment vying for consumers' time. The latest Digital Media Trends survey from Deloitte, released in late March, revealed that Generation Z, those consumers ages 14 to 25, spend more time playing games than watching movies or television series at home, or even listening to music.

The majority of Gen Z and Millennial consumers polled said they spend more time watching user-created videos like those on TikTok and YouTube than watching films or shows on a streaming service.

Netflix, recognizing the shift in consumer entertainment habits, has begun to invest in gaming, but it does not yet contribute materially to the company's revenue.

MEXICO CITY, April 19 (Reuters) - Mexico has disbanded a select anti-narcotics unit that for a quarter of a century worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to tackle organized crime, two sources said, in a major blow to bilateral security cooperation.

The group was one of the Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) operating in about 15 countries which U.S. officials tout as invaluable in dismantling powerful smuggling rings and busting countless drug lords around the globe. The units are trained by the DEA but under the control of national governments.

In Mexico, the over 50 officers in the SIU police unit were considered many of the country's best and worked on the biggest cases such as the 2016 capture of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, then the boss of the powerful Sinaloa cartel.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The closure threatens to imperil U.S. efforts to combat organized crime groups inside Mexico, one of the epicenters of the multi-billion dollar global narcotics trade, and make it harder to catch and prosecute cartel leaders.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government formally notified the DEA in April last year that the unit had been shut down, according to a DEA agent with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak about the issue. A second source familiar with the situation confirmed the closure of the unit.

Mexico's Public Security Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The DEA declined to comment. The closure of the unit was not reported before. Reuters was unable to find out why the Mexican government did not announce it publicly at the time.

""They strangled it,"" the agent said, referring to the unit. ""It shatters the bridges we spent decades putting together.""

The closure could prove costly on U.S. streets, where authorities are battling to reduce a surge in overdoses that last year led to more than 100,000 deaths mostly linked to a new wave of synthetic drugs produced by Mexican cartels.

The elite team, founded in 1997, was the main conduit for the DEA to share leads on drugs shipments and tips obtained on U.S. soil with Mexico's government.

The DEA would fly new Mexican entrants to its state-of-the-art facility in Quantico, Virginia, to train them on latest surveillance and policing techniques. U.S. officials also vetted them, including with polygraph tests.

A second Mexican SIU unit, based inside the Attorney General's Office and independent of Lopez Obrador's government, continues to operate.

For Mike Vigil, the DEA's former chief of international operations, the SIU closure and Lopez Obrador's curbing of security cooperation will hurt both countries.

""It will mean more drugs going to the United States and more violence in Mexico,"" he said.

SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE FOOT

The SIU's closure is the latest example of the breakdown in cooperation between the DEA and Mexico since Lopez Obrador assumed power in 2018 and vowed to overhaul the country's security policy.

Angered by the soaring bloodshed he blamed on the heavy-handed tactics of his predecessors, Lopez Obrador sought to implement a less confrontational policing style and pledged to tackle what he claims are the root causes of the violence, such as poverty, instead of hunting down cartel chiefs.

The president also made it harder for foreign security officials to operate inside Mexico, rebuking the DEA over its modus operandi which he said equated to trampling on Mexico's sovereignty.

Privately, U.S. officials say Mexico's vital role in blocking the flow of migrants from Latin America - a priority for Washington - leaves them with limited leverage to pressure Lopez Obrador on other issues, such as security cooperation.

Though the SIU's reputation was damaged when its former chief, Ivan Reyes Arzate, was detained in 2017 and pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to taking bribes to leak tips to a drug gang, the unit was seen as vital by DEA officials who needed Mexican officers to help their investigations in the country.

Alarm bells for the future of the unit rang in 2019, when Lopez Obrador mothballed the Federal Police - inside which the SIU was based - to create a new force called the National Guard.

DEA agents kept working with Mexican counterparts for a while, especially in Mexico City's airport where SIU officers were intercepting smuggled fentanyl, a hyper-potent synthetic drug blamed for soaring overdoses in the United States.

But security cooperation between the DEA and Mexico plummeted to a fresh low in Oct. 2020 when U.S. security officials in Los Angeles detained Mexico's former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos, alleging he colluded with a drug cartel.

U.S. prosecutors swiftly released Cienfuegos, citing ""sensitive"" foreign policy considerations, but Lopez Obrador accused the DEA of having ""little professionalism"" and of fabricating evidence in the case.

In Dec. 2020, Lopez Obrador's government stripped foreign agents of diplomatic immunity and forced Mexican officials to write reports on interactions with security officers from abroad.

""That was the nail in the coffin,"" the DEA agent said. Months later the SIU was shut down.

By the time the unit was formally wound up it had, according to the DEA agent, already been inoperative for some time as Mexico's National Guard prioritized the deterrence of violence over investigations of drug cartels.

But with more than 33,000 homicides recorded in Mexico last year, Vigil, the ex-DEA agent, said closing an elite unit that goes after organized crime groups responsible for most of the murders doesn't make sense.

""Mexico is shooting itself in the foot,"" he said.

April 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education has canceled student loan debt for 40,000 people and offered credits to help another 3.6 million pay off their loans under a plan announced on Tuesday designed to aid low-income borrowers and public servants.

""Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it's certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they're eligible for,"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in the statement.

The measures add to other steps taken by the administration of President Joe Biden, including a pause on nearly all student loan collection, but they stop short of demands from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party for comprehensive student loan forgiveness.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

In his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden called for canceling $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower, a commitment of more than $400 billion. Since he was elected, the White House has said Congress must take action for wider student loan relief.

The government said it was addressing ""historical failures"" to communicate to borrowers all the benefits they were eligible for in federal student loan programs.

At least 40,000 borrowers will receive immediate debt cancellation under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.

Several thousand borrowers with older loans will also receive forgiveness through income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness, plus another 3.6 million borrowers will receive at least three years of additional credit toward IDR forgiveness, the Education Department said in a statement.

Those programs cap the amount lower-income borrowers are required to pay and forgive the remaining balance after a set number of years.

Student loan debt is seen as a drag on the economy, burdening young professionals for years after graduation, while the wide availability of loans has contributed to rising tuition.

Some 43.4 million borrowers are carrying about $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loans from the Federal Loan Portfolio, an average of more than $37,000 each, according to the Education Data Initiative.

The Biden administration canceled more than $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers in its first year in office while also extending a pause on loan repayment that has provided at least temporary relief for 41 million borrowers, the Education Department said.

"April 19 (Reuters) - A Black man who was killed by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, police officer during a traffic stop earlier this month, sparking protests in the city, was shot in the back of the head, a forensic pathologist who performed an independent autopsy said on Tuesday.

During a news conference in Detroit, forensic pathologist Werner Spitz and attorneys for the family of Patrick Lyoya said the autopsy found the 26-year-old was shot once and that the police officer held his gun to the back of Lyoya's head.

""That is now scientific evidence of this tragic killing where his family believes was an execution,"" civil rights attorney Ben Crump said during the news conference.

Spitz said he found no signs of a struggle such as scratches or bruises on Lyoya's body, noting that the only injury was a bullet wound.

He also said he did not know the caliber of bullet that was fired, but that it was a ""powerful bullet"" that killed the man.

The death of Lyoya, a Congolese refugee, outraged members of his family and touched off protests in Grand Rapids by activists who say it represents the latest example of police violence against young Black men.

Lyoya's family is demanding that authorities dismiss the officer who shot him from the force and file criminal charges against him. read more

Grand Rapids police were not immediately available to comment in response to the independent autopsy findings.

Grand Rapids police officials have placed the officer, who has not been named publicly, on administrative leave, and have asked the Michigan State Police to investigate the shooting.

Kent County Chief Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle said in a statement that he performed an autopsy on the day of the incident and prepared a death certificate with the cause and manner of death.

He also said toxicology and tissue results were pending and may take 60 days to be completed and that the full autopsy report will not be made public until the State Police concludes its investigation.

""We have to investigate whether this was a class 'driving while black' case,"" attorney Crump said, noting that the officer was traveling in the opposite direction of Lyoya before the stop.

Last week, police released videos of the incident taken from the dashboard of the officer's squad car, from his body-worn camera and from a neighbor's surveillance camera.

They show Lyoya stepping out of the car on a rainy street, seemingly confused and asking ""What did I do?"" as the policeman repeatedly asks for a driver's license and orders him to get back inside the vehicle.

Lyoya appears to be complying, but then closes the driver's- side door and attempts to walk away, resisting the officer's attempts to handcuff him.

Following a short foot chase, the two men grapple on the lawn, at one point fighting over the officer's stun gun, before Lyoya is shot.

The incident began after the officer stopped Lyoya over suspicions involving his license plate.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's military has received additional aircraft as well parts for repairs to get damaged aircraft flying again, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

Ukraine has defied expectations of allies and military experts by not only keeping its air force operational nearly two months after the start of Russia's invasion but actually repairing aircraft and, apparently, adding to its inventory.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby did not offer details on which countries provided aircraft, but acknowledged new transfers and said Ukraine had more operable fighter aircraft than it had two weeks ago.

""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby told a news briefing, without elaborating.

Kirby said Washington had not provided any aircraft to Kyiv.

""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said.

Still, that might soon change. The United States has announced plans to transfer Russian-made helicopters to Ukraine that had once been intended for Afghanistan.

More than 50 days into the war, the skies over Ukraine are still contested in part due to Ukraine's fleet of aircraft and air defenses, including portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles provided by the United States and its allies.

That has allowed Ukraine to wage a much more effective ground campaign than if Russia had air dominance and could defend its invading forces from the skies.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce within the coming days another military aid package for Ukraine about the same size as the $800 million one announced last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a new package was expected that would be roughly the size of the previous package but details were still being worked out.

If this week's aid package is as large as expected, it would bring total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February to well over $3 billion.

While some in Western capitals argue that Russia's actions should mean it is excluded from global meetings altogether, that is not a view shared by others in the Group of 20 big economies, including notably China and Indonesia, which is chairing the group this year.

Moscow confirmed on Tuesday Finance Minister Anton Siluanov would lead Russia's delegation at the talks despite repeated protestations by Western diplomats that they could not go ahead as usual during a war in which thousands of civilians have died in bombardments by Russian troops.

""During and after the meeting we will be certain to send a strong message and we will not be alone in doing so,"" a German government source said, accusing Russia of starting a conflict that has also sent world food and energy prices spiraling.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to avoid G20 sessions joined by Russian officials on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings. But Yellen will attend an opening session on the Ukraine war regardless of Russian participation, a U.S. Treasury official said.

British finance minister Rishi Sunak also will not attend certain G20 sessions, a British government source told Reuters. read more

And a French finance ministry official meanwhile expected some ministers from Group of Seven nations to leave their seats when their Russian peer was due to speak.

'UNRAVELING' RISK

The divisions widened by the Ukraine war raise questions over the G20's future as the world's premier economic policy forum.

Conceived as a platform for the biggest wealthy and developing economies to cooperate on recovery efforts during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, the G20 has since broached everything from global tax reform to pandemic debt relief and the fight against climate change, with a patchy record of success.

""The G20 is at risk of unraveling and this week is incredibly important,"" said Josh Lipsky, director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center and a former IMF adviser.

Should Western democracies allow the group to wither in favor of the G7 or other groupings, it would cede significant economic influence to China, Lipsky said.

""Russia can align with China and I think that's a good outcome from Russia's perspective and actually gives them more influence than they have in a body like the G20,"" he said.

Both the French and the German official said there would be no agreed communique at the end of a meeting which had been originally due to discuss the state of the global economy and coordinating vaccine and other pandemic efforts.

Apart from the G7 nations - the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy - the G20 also incorporates emerging economies including China, India and Brazil that have starkly different views on how the global economy should work.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fact that some G20 nations have chosen not to follow Western sanctions on Russia is only the latest challenge to efforts to construct a global set of rules for trade and finance.

The United States and China have long traded accusations of protectionism, while the fact that world trade is growing more slowly than the global economy as a whole has prompted questions about the future of globalization.

Ahead of the G20 meeting, a top IMF official warned of the risk of a fragmenting global economy.

""One scenario is one where we have divided blocs that are not trading much with each other, that are on different standards, and that would be a disaster for the global economy,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters.

Separately, the Fund slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, citing Russia's war in Ukraine, and warning inflation was a ""clear and present danger"" for many countries. read more

ATHENS, April 19 (Reuters) - Greece has impounded a Russian oil tanker off the island of Evia, the Greek coastguard said on Tuesday, as part of European Union sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, the EU banned Russian-flagged vessels from the 27-nation bloc's ports, with some exemptions, as it adopted new sweeping sanctions against Russia for what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"".

The 115,500-deadweight tonnage Russian-flagged Pegas, with 19 Russian crew members on board, was seized near Karystos on the southern coast of Evia, which lies just off the Greek mainland near Athens.

The Russian embassy in Athens, the Greek capital, said on Twitter that it was looking into the case and was in contact with Greek authorities on the issue.

""It has been seized as part of EU sanctions,"" a Greek shipping ministry official said.

A coastguard official said the ship's oil cargo had not been confiscated. It was not clear who the charterer of the cargo was, but the vessel was managed by Russia-based Transmorflot.

Transmorflot was not immediately available for comment.

The Pegas, which was renamed Lana in March, had earlier reported an engine problem. It was headed to the southern Peloponnese peninsula to offload its cargo onto another tanker but rough seas forced it to moor just off Karystos where it was seized, Athens News Agency reported.

On Tuesday afternoon the ship was still moored at Karystos bay, Reuters witnesses said.

U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic through ship and satellite tracking, said the Pegas loaded around 700,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran's Sirri Island on Aug. 19, 2021.

It subsequently tried to unload the cargo at a Turkish port before heading to Greece, UANI said its analysis showed.

VILNIUS, April 19 (Reuters) - Lithuania's parliament on Tuesday voted to ban public displays of the letter ""Z"", the black and orange ribbon of St George, and other symbols seen as expressing support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are prominently marked with the letter ""Z"", and it has started appearing on social media and on clothing elsewhere in support of the war.

Meanwhile the ribbon of St George, first introduced as an honour by Catherine the Great, has gained significance in the Russian-speaking world since separatists in eastern Ukraine adopted it as a symbol of their support for Russia in 2014.

To an earlier ban on public displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols, parliament added a provision for ""the symbols of totalitarian or authoritarian regimes used in the past or currently use to promote military aggression, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed or perpetrated by them.""

Lawmakers also approved that fines for breaching the ban should be raised to 900 euros ($827) for persons and up to 1,500 euros for companies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

The Lithuanian decision comes after similar bans in Latvia and Moldova. Germany was also considering such ban. read more

Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in March called for a universal ban of the political use of the letter ""Z,"" saying it signified ""Russian war crimes, bombed out cities, thousands of murdered Ukrainians.""

KYIV, April 19 (Reuters) - The aim of Russia's new military offensive in east Ukraine is to grab land, establish an overground link between territories in the east and Crimea, and crush Ukraine's armed forces, Ukraine's defence ministry said on Tuesday.

Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuznyak said Russian forces were attacking along the entire frontline in eastern Ukraine, pressing their siege of Mariupol in the south and trying to encircle cities in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""The goal is to defeat the Ukrainian forces, to establish control over the territory of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and establish a land corridor to Crimea,"" Motuznyak told a briefing.

Russian-backed separatists who rose up in 2014 have declared so-called people's republics in territory they control in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said Moscow wants to seize Mariupol and all the territory that Ukrainian government forces still hold in Luhansk and Donetsk to create a land link with Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.

""The main efforts are to break through the positions held by Ukrainian troops and they have not stopped trying to gain full control over Mariupol,"" Motuznyak said.

Summing up Russia's tactics, he said: ""Usually, they are: powerful artillery preparation, an attempt to storm particular positions, attempts to stymie the actions of units of Ukraine's armed forces, attempts to surround our units, and to capture settlements. Russia is mainly waging war according to the textbooks of the Soviet era.""

REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The White House announced on Tuesday that it has finalized regulations guiding environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects like highways and pipelines that would consider their climate impacts and other factors.

The White House Council for Environmental Quality has now officially restored key provisions of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations that had been in place before the Trump administration overhauled the rules last year for the first time in decades.

The change will require federal agencies to consider the “direct,” “indirect,” and “cumulative” impacts of proposed projects or actions, including a full evaluation of climate change impacts and assessment of the impact of releasing additional pollution in communities that are already choked by polluted air or dirty water.

“Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time,” said CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory.

In addition to requiring an analysis of climate impacts, the final rule empowers federal agencies to consider alternative designs or approaches for a company's proposed projects and allows agencies to adopt reviews that are more stringent than CEQ's regulations.

The council also announced on Tuesday that it plans to propose a ""phase 2"" NEPA rulemaking in the coming months that will improve the efficiency of the review processes.

Former President Donald Trump in 2020 revamped NEPA in an effort to fast-track major projects like the now-cancelled Keystone XL oil pipeline that he said got caught up in red tape and interfered with his focus on U.S. ""energy dominance.""

His NEPA overhaul allowed federal agencies to exclude the climate impact of a project, allowing major fossil fuel projects to sail through the approval process and avoid legal challenges.

Over the last few years, however, federal courts had ruled that NEPA required the federal government to consider a project’s carbon footprint in decisions relating to leasing public lands for drilling or building pipelines.

"After years of speculation, we finally know what Google’s first in-house smartwatch will be called. Surprising absolutely no one, a new trademark filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office reveals it is... Pixel Watch.

The filing (via 9to5 Google) is about as barebones as it gets. The description says the Pixel Watch name is “intended to cover the categories of smartwatches; cases adapted for holding smartwatches; wearable computers in the nature of smartwatches; smartwatch straps; smartwatch bands.” Further on in the filing, it’s noted that while the Pixel Watch name is not in current use, there is an intent to use it. Not to mention, Google recently changed its store to more prominently feature watches. Clearly, Google has smartwatches on the brain.

The name signals Google’s intent for the wearable as a companion to its Pixel phones

Granted, this name was wholly expected, even if it’s a tad anticlimactic. Tech media has been referring to the concept of a Made by Google smartwatch as the Pixel Watch for years. It also makes sense when you consider that Big Tech has used smartwatches to further their ecosystems. By naming it the Pixel Watch, Google signals its intent for the wearable to be a companion to its Pixel phones. And if that brings more people into Google’s web of gadgets and services... Well, that’s been the plan all along.

We already have a fairly good idea of what to expect. News that Google would finally make the Pixel Watch real broke in December, and there have been several leaks of renders and watch faces. It’s also been long expected that Google will tease the Pixel Watch at Google I/O next month — which the timing of this trademark filing heavily supports. It’s also expected that the Pixel Watch will feature some kind of Fitbit integration with Wear OS 3. The smartwatch is also expected to cost more than a Fitbit and serve as a direct Apple Watch competitor.

There are plenty of reasons why 2022 is the year that the stars have finally aligned for the Pixel Watch. But despite false starts and rumors that never panned out, Google has been laying the groundwork for Android-first smartwatches for years. Not only was it first to the wearable game in 2014 with Android Wear, which has since been rebranded as Wear OS. In 2019, it was revealed that a Pixel Watch nearly debuted years ago. The only reason it didn’t was those early attempts “didn’t look like what belonged in the Pixel family.” And to be fair, it was the right call, as the LG Watch Style and LG Watch Sport were godawful.

That does hint that this new watch is something that Google is proud to put its name on. We’ll have to see what happens at Google I/O, but it looks like the long wait is finally coming to an end.","Victoria Song, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/22/23037926/pixel-watch-google-smartwatch-trademark,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VmM7AIVT7ro9wF1rmYju0NuWdzY=/0x146:2040x1214/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/22996109/dbohn_211105_4864_0001.jpg,Verge

All-private SpaceX astronaut mission to return home from the ISS after nearly week-long delay,"New York (CNN Business) The first all-private mission to the International Space Station is slated to complete the final leg of its journey this weekend, capping off what turned into a longer-than-expected journey after bad weather kept the passengers on the space station for several extra days.

The mission, called AX-1, was brokered by the Houston, Texas-based startup Axiom Space , which books rocket rides, provides all the necessary training, and coordinates flights to the ISS for anyone who can afford it.

The four crew members — Michael López-Alegría, a former NASA astronaut-turned-Axiom employee who is commanding the mission; Israeli businessman Eytan Stibbe; Canadian investor Mark Pathy; and Ohio-based real estate magnate Larry Connor — are slated to leave the space station aboard their SpaceX Crew Dragon capsule on Saturday at 8:35 pm ET. They'll spend a day free flying through orbit before plummeting back into the atmosphere and parachuting to a splashdown landing off the coast of Florida at about 1:46 pm ET Sunday.

AX-1, which launched on April 8 , was originally billed as a 10-day mission, but delays extended the mission by nearly a week.

During their first 12 days on the space station, the group stuck to a regimented schedule, which included about 14 hours per day of activities, including scientific research that wasdesigned by various research hospitals, universities, tech companies and more. They also spent time doing outreach events by video conferencing with children and students.

The weather delays then afforded to them ""a bit more time to absorb the remarkable views of the blue planet and review the vast amount of work that was successfully completed during the mission,"" according to Axiom

It's not clear how much this mission cost. Axiom previously disclosed a price of $55 million per seat for a 10-day trip to the ISS, but the company declined to comment on the financial terms for this specific mission beyond saying in a press conference last year that the price is in the ""tens of millions.""

The mission has been made possible by very close coordination among Axiom, SpaceX and NASA, since the ISS is government-funded and operated. And the space agency has revealed some details about how much it charges for use of its 20-year-old orbiting laboratory.

For each mission, bringing on the necessary support from NASA astronauts will cost commercial customers $5.2 million, and all the mission support and planning that NASA lends is another $4.8 million. While in space, food alone costs an estimated $2,000 per day, per person. Getting provisions to and from the space station for a commercial crew is another $88,000 to $164,000 per person, per day.

But the extra days the AX-1 crew spent in space due to weather won't add to their own personal overall price tag, according to a statement from NASA.

""Knowing that International Space Station mission objectives like the recently conducted Russian spacewalk or weather challenges could result in a delayed undock, NASA negotiated the contract with a strategy that does not require reimbursement for additional undock delays,"" the statement reads.

But AX-1 is the first mission with a crew entirely comprised of private citizens with no active members of a government astronaut corps accompanying them in the capsule during the trip to and from the ISS. It's also the first time private citizens have traveled to the ISS on a US-made spacecraft.

The mission has set off yet another round of debate about whether people who pay their way to space should be referred to as ""astronauts,"" though it should be noted a trip to the ISS requires a far larger investment of both time and money than taking a brief suborbital ride on a rocket built by companies like Blue Origin or Virgin Galactic

López-Alegría, a veteran of four trips to space between 1995 and 2007 during his time with NASA, had this to say about it: ""This mission is very different from what you may have heard of in some of the recent — especially suborbital — missions. We are not space tourists. I think there's an important role for space tourism, but it is not what Axiom is about.""","Jackie Wattles, Cnn Business",https://cnn.com/2022/04/23/tech/spacex-ax-1-undocking-saturday-scn/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220422112119-21-axiom-mission-ax-1-spacex-iss-0415-super-tease.jpg,CNN

Beware the 'melt-up:' Analysts say stocks may soar just before they collapse,"New York (CNN Business) Storm clouds appear to be gathering over Wall Street, with many analysts saying a downturn is inevitable. But before the party winds down, some expect an explosive pre-crash rally — known as a ""melt-up.""

Melt-ups usually occur without any obvious economic reason for the gains. They happen when investors buy assets based on greed, or fear of missing out, instead of fundamental improvements.

First, some quick context: The past five years have been very, very good for investors. The S&P 500 has grown by nearly 90%, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq has grown over 140%. That includes two years of a pandemic that shuttered businesses and snarled global supply chains.

Now the market is grappling with the sobering reality that all bull runs end eventually.

New York CNN Business —

investors who have been blindly buying all big techs got a rude awakening this week after Netflix imploded. But the good news from Tesla proves that some top momentum stocks can still thrive in this rocky market.

The latest results from Tesla (TSLA) and Netflix (NFLX) show how silly it is for investors to buy into themes and memes like the FAANGs, or MT. FAANG, if you want to add Microsoft (MSFT) and Tesla (TSLA) to the Facebook (FB) (Meta)/Amazon (AMZN)/Apple (AAPL)/Netflix (NFLX)/Google (GOOGL) (Alphabet) quintet.

This is a stock picker’s market.

“This environment will create an important backdrop for active investing,” said Ken McAtamney, head of William Blair’s global equity team, in a report.


One of the biggest mistakes that an investor can make is assuming that all stocks in a certain sector should rise and fall in tandem. That’s an overly simplistic, binary view of the world.

Instead, investors need to do their homework and find companies with strong business models and healthy fundamentals.

“Not all businesses are created equally,” said Paul Moroz, chief investment officer with Mawer Investment Management.

Moroz said that it’s going to become more important to find companies that aren’t as dependent on discretionary consumer spending. He noted that firms like insurance broker Marsh & McLennan (MMC) and UK-based cleaning supplies firm Bunzl (BZLFY) are examples of “boring” companies that are doing well.

And even within the tech sector, Moroz said he likes Microsoft (MSFT) because of the steady subscription revenue for its many business software products.

The Big Tech leaders of the Nasdaq are a broad and diverse group. That’s why investors shouldn’t assume that Netflix’s problems are bad for the rest of the tech sector or that Tesla’s good news gives traders the all clear sign to buy every momentum stock in sight.

“First quarter results so far highlight our view that investors need to be selective,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, in a report this week.

Haefele added that “Tesla’s record profit underlines rising global demand for electric vehicles,” and also pointed out that “the disappointing outcome for Netflix shouldn’t obscure the robust outlook for subscription services.”

Netflix’s big miss could wind up being a company specific issue. It’s not necessarily a reason to shun all of the other FAANGs.

Of course, investors are still willing to flock to companies that are reporting strong results. The success of Tesla shows that traders are not afraid of high-priced stocks that value investing gurus like Warren Buffett tend to avoid.

Yes, Tesla is expensive when you look at traditional price-to-earnings ratios and compare Tesla with the rest of the auto industry. But as long as Tesla lives up to the hype, that may not matter.

“Tesla’s ability to achieve a trillion dollar valuation…is a confirmation that paying up for future earnings potential is still a rational investment with the right business model,” said Louis Navellier, founder of Navellier & Associates, in a report Thursday.",Paul R. La Monica,https://cnn.com/2022/04/22/investing/stock-market-tesla-netflix/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220401080454-tesla-us-dealership-0328.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",CNN
Le Pen victory in French election could be bigger shock to markets than Brexit,"London (CNN Business) French voters are expected to hand Emmanuel Macron five more years in office on Sunday, favoring the president over far-right candidate Marine Le Pen after a strong showing in a fiery debate . But investors remain on edge.

With polls indicating the presidential election is narrower than when the two candidates faced off in 2017, traders are girding for a surprise Le Pen win, which would rattle Europe's second biggest economy as fears of a recession in the region grow.

""It could be bigger than Brexit. It could be bigger than Trump, if Le Pen prevails,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.

In research published on Tuesday, strategists at Citi put the probability of a Le Pen win at 35%. Still, they encouraged clients to hedge their bets on French government bonds, and cautioned that a Le Pen win would hurt stocks.

""Uncertainty stems from the risk of low voter turnout, as leftist voters refuse to give their vote to Macron, even at the risk of handing over to Le Pen,"" they wrote. ""Voter turnout is a factor that pollsters find particularly hard to forecast accurately.""

Victory for Le Pen would immediately raise questions about France's political and economic ties to the European Union, even though she has dropped her pledge to take the country out of the bloc. Her policy goals — like stopping foreign workers from coming to France, which would end freedom of movement in Europe — could still create serious conflict.

""Most of [Le Pen's] policies would not be possible inside the EU,"" said Grégory Claeys, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels.

That could spark a ""Frexit,"" or French exit from the European Union ""by accident,"" he continued. If France, under Le Pen, pushed ahead with policies that broke EU law, he predicted there would be an exodus of capital as investors pull cash from the country, as when the United Kingdom voted for Brexit in 2016.

Economy front and center

Le Pen built support during the first round of voting earlier this month by focusing on the soaring cost of living while scaling back her rhetoric against immigrants and Islam.

""My absolute priority of the next five years is to give French people back their money,"" she said in the televised debate with Macron on Wednesday.

As inflation eats into spending, economists have warned that France's economy could shrink later this year

""Wages, especially low wages, are not increasing by the same proportion as the increase in prices,"" said Boris Plazzi, a board member of the Confédération Générale du Travail, a workers union with 700,000 members. ""Therefore, there is a real concern on the part of workers.""

Le Pen has pledged to restore between €150 ($163) and €200 ($217) per month in household purchasing power by slashing taxes on fuel, reducing road tolls and cutting social benefits like subsidized housing for foreigners.

""Food and fuel prices have really dominated the day-to-day campaign,"" said Mujtaba Rahman, managing director for Europe at Eurasia Group, a consultancy. ""That's one of the reasons she's been so successful.""

But Macron criticized her plans in Wednesday's debate, noting that it makes more sense to continue government policies that help the poorest, rather than pursuing less targeted measures like cutting fuel taxes.

He also highlighted the 1.2 million jobs created during his presidency, and said the government would maintain a temporary cap on electricity and gas prices, which has helped keep inflation lower than elsewhere in Europe.

Still, rising prices are a risk to Macron as he tries to court millions of voters who remain undecided. Roughly 40% of France's population live on less than €1,600 ($1,736) per month, and many of them abstained or voted for hard-left candidate Jean-Luc Mélenchon in the first round of the election, according to newspaper Le Monde

If Le Pen wins

Scrutiny of Le Pen has increased since the first round, particularly over her past support for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Macron remains the favorite. Eurasia Group thinks he has an 80% chance of reelection.

If Le Pen were to win, however, it would jolt financial markets, which have already been on edge due to the war in Ukraine and waning expectations for economic growth

When Donald Trump was elected president of the United States in 2016, markets initially panicked. But the fears were short lived , as investors decided cooler heads would prevail and Trump would be prevented from pursuing his most extreme policies.

The effects of the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union lasted longer. The British pound crashed, and still hasn't recovered its level in June 2016.


""Markets seem complacent about a Macron victory, even though the probability of a non-market friendly victory by Le Pen is not negligible,"" Vincent Mortier, the chief investment officer, said in a note.

While Le Pen has reversed her previous proposal for France to leave the European Union, she's still committed to reducing ties between France and the bloc by launching a series of referendums. If she does try to bar workers from other parts of the European Union from coming to France, or takes steps to impede the free movement of goods, it would still trigger fraught questions about the future of the country — and of the EU itself.

""Even though exiting the EU is not officially in the program, given the policies she wants to put in place, it would lead to a confrontation with European partners,"" Bruegel's Claeys said.

Much would ride on legislative elections in June, which would determine the strength of any Le Pen mandate.

""A win for Marine Le Pen would need to be followed by a strong showing for her party in June's legislative elections if she is to implement most of her program,"" said Jessica Hinds, Europe economist at Capital Economics.

If she needs to seek out a broader coalition of support, it ""would clip her wings, at least on domestic policy,"" Hinds continued. ""So a Le Pen presidency might be less radical than many investors fear.""

Revenge spending may keep the economy chugging along,"New York (CNN Business) Now that some mask and vaccine mandates are being lifted, consumers seem ready to spend on travel and other leisure experiences. Call it the ""revenge spending"" phenomenon.

Airline and hotel stocks have been surging this year thanks in part to a spate of long overdue revenge spending, or what some are dubbing the YOLO economy. An ETF of travel companies run by investing firm SonicShares, with the ticker symbol of ""TRYP "" is up nearly 6% this year while the S&P 500 has fallen 9%.

Gap is in turmoil,"New York (CNN Business) Old Navy has long been the crown jewel of Gap's otherwise inconsistent businesses. But now, even Old Navy is struggling. And that's weighing on its parent company in a big way.

Gap GPS said Thursday it is replacing Old Navy CEO Nancy Green and launching a search for a new chief executive. Gap also slashed its sales guidance for the first quarter of 2022 as a result of ""execution challenges"" at Old Navy and said it is ramping up promotions to clear out unsold merchandise.

The announcement sent shares tumbling around 20% Friday. As of Friday, Gap's stock had dropped around 57% over the past 12 months.


Old Navy has pointed to supply chain problems for its recent struggles, but sales were slumping before supply chain snarls popped up during the pandemic.

4 ways Russia is trying to prove it can live with sanctions,"London (CNN Business) Russian President Vladimir Putin has devoted considerable airtime over the past few weeks to reassuring the Russian public that sanctions hurt the West more than they hurt Russia.

Putin is preparing his country for the long haul. ""The collective West does not plan on backing off its policy of economic pressure on Russia,"" he told aviation executives recently. Every sector of Russia's economy needs to ""make a long-term plan based on internal opportunities.""

Putin's policy of self-reliance was predictable. Ever since Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 , the country has been preparing for increased Western sanctions with a strategy dubbed "" Fortress Russia .""

And yet the scale of the economic counter-offensive waged by the West since the invasion of Ukraine on February 24, along with the rising tide of companies cutting off business with Russia to guard against reputational risk or future sanctions, was a shock.

""No one who was predicting what kinds of sanctions the West could bring in could have thought this,"" admitted Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov in March, referring to the freezing of half of Russia's $600 billion in reserves.

Russia says it will challenge the sanctions on its foreign reserves in court and has also threatened to sue if it is deemed to have defaulted on its debt because of the asset freeze.

Meanwhile, here are some of the ways companies, industries, and officials are scrambling to live with Russia's new normal.

1. Redesigning the Lada

Russia's iconic Soviet-era domestic car brand is very reliant on imported parts. Avtovaz, which produces the Lada, is owned by French carmaker Renault, and according to Evgeny Eskov, editor-in-chief of Russian car industry journal Auto Business Review, the companies share a single procurement system for parts.

On March 24, in response to the news that Renault was exiting the Russian market , Avtovaz revealed it was having to quickly redesign several models so they would be less reliant on imported components.

Lada automobiles stand at the parking lot of a Lada car dealership in Tolyatti, also known as Togliatti, on April 1.

The company did not elaborate on which models would be effected, but said they would gradually become available in the coming months. Eskov said the redesigned models will be simpler versions of current cars, without extra features such as ABS. ""Just brutal cars from the past,"" he wrote in an email to CNN Business.

2. Luring Instagrammers to Vkontakte

Instagram was — until recently — the top social network in Russia based on monthly users, according to social media analysis firm Brand Analytics. Vkontakte, Russia's domestic version of Facebook, was second.

Since the invasion, and especially since Russia's communications regulator cut off access to Facebook and Instagram last month, Vkontakte has been pulling out all the stops to lure content creators over to its platform.

The company is foregoing its commission on any monetized content until the end of April and offering free promotion on the platform for any content creator who has moved from another platform or reactivated their page since March 1. It has also published a step-by-step guide to launching a business on Vkontakte.

Vkontakte's own data shows this could be working. Monthly users hit a record of over 100 million in March. According to Brand Analytics, Instagram lost almost half of its active Russian-language users between Feb. 24 and April 6.


Levakova considered shutting down after she was inundated with anti-war comments and messages in the first few weeks after the invasion. Those have since died down, but she has removed a line in her page description that mentioned Tsarist Russia. Now it simply says ""historical weaving.""

""I just couldn't take the flood of aggression,"" Levakova admits. Orders are still coming in, but she says it's too early to say whether her business will be impacted.

3. Homegrown credit cards

Russia has been preparing for financial isolation since some of its biggest banks were hit with sanctions after the annexation of Crimea. In some ways, it paid off. Russia's National Payment Card System and the bank card system built on it, known as ""Mir,"" have grown exponentially.

According to the Russian central bank, more than 113 million Mir cards were issued in 2021, up from a total of 1.76 million at the end of 2016. Last year, about a quarter of all card payments in Russia were made on Mir cards.

This growth, experts say, was partly engineered by Russia. ""They didn't make it very appealing to ordinary Russians before the invasion,"" says Maria Shagina, a visiting senior fellow at the Finnish Institute for International Affairs. Instead the government mandated that public sector employees, pensioners and anyone receiving benefits had to use a Mir card.

A branch of Sberbank of Russia PJSC in Moscow, Russia, on Monday, February 28.

That meant that when Visa and Mastercard announced in early March they were suspending transactions and operations in Russia, there was an alternative already in place.

But Mir is not a direct replacement. It only works in Russia and a handful of other countries, mainly former Soviet states.

That lack of global reach also hobbled Russia's attempt to build an alternative to SWIFT , the international payments system. Its own version, known as SPFS, had 400 participants last year, compared with 11,000 on SWIFT.

""The network effect is not there because foreign participants are not keen on joining it,"" Shagina said. ""If you don't trust Russia in other respects why would you trust this system?""

4. Jobs in public works


""The more they clamp down on demonstrations, the more I understand that they're worried about unemployment,"" she said. More than 15,000 people were arrested in Russia in the early weeks of the conflict for taking part in anti-war protests, and the Kremlin has effectively silenced independent media by criminalizing what it deems to be ""fake information"" on its so-called ""special military operation.""


The solution, according to a recent post on his blog, is to give the workers left behind something ""useful"" to do. The options he outlines include jobs administering official documents like passports and birth certificates, work at one of the city's parks or at temporary health centers that the city has recently started setting up. $41 million is being set aside to create these jobs and retrain workers.

For Russians who built a career at McKinsey or Goldman Sachs before the war, this would be an abrupt change. But Ribakova said it probably won't come to that. She believes the majority of executives from foreign companies will leave the country, if they haven't already.

What next?

Russia has so far managed to withstand the initial force of Western sanctions without its financial system collapsing. That's largely thanks to the central bank, which immediately raised interest rates to 20% — it has since lowered them to 17% — and imposed strict capital controls.

But this does not mean Russia is through the worst. The economy could shrink by 8.5% this year, according to the IMF. The collapse could be even bigger if Europe bans Russian oil imports . And inflation is at 17.5%, something even Putin admits is hurting Russian citizens.

Another key risk, experts say, is Russia's reliance on imported products — many of which are now subject to sanctions. Those can be harder for the Kremlin to counter than measures aimed at the macro economy.

""There is a feeling, especially in the government, that they're going to turn the corner and then there will be a monster,"" says Ribakova. ""And they just don't know when exactly that monster is going to eat them up.""",Clare Sebastian,https://cnn.com/2022/04/22/business/russia-living-with-sanctions/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220421114353-russian-central-bank-moscow-economy-sanctions-super-tease.jpg,CNN

Carlos Ghosn says he has to tell his side of the story

Paris/London CNN Business —

France has issued an arrest warrant for Carlos Ghosn, the fugitive auto executive who used to lead Renault (RNLSY)-Nissan (NSANF).

The prosecutor’s office in Nanterre, near Paris, confirmed to CNN on Friday that it had issued an international arrest warrant for Ghosn, who now lives in Lebanon, and the owners of Suhail Bahwan Automobiles, an Omani vehicle distributor.

“The judge overseeing the case has issued five international arrest warrants against M. Carlos Ghosn and the current owners or former leaders of the Omani company SBA,” a spokesperson for the prosecutor’s office said in a statement.

French media, including CNN affiliate BFMTV, reported the warrant relates to more than 15 million euros ($16.3 million) in alleged suspicious payments between Renault-Nissan and SBA.

The prosecutor’s office told CNN the warrant targets many facts and “concerns offenses that may be charged in the context of the entire case currently under investigation.”

SBA did not respond to a request for comment outside normal working hours.

Ghosn has always denied allegations of financial misconduct at the automotive giant and said he fled house arrest in Japan in 2019 — where he faced charges of filing false financial statements — because he did not believe he would receive a fair trial.

Ghosn’s lawyer Jean Tamalet, a partner at firm King & Spalding, told CNN Business in a statement Friday that the warrant was “surprising.”

“The investigating judge and the Nanterre prosecutor know perfectly well that Carlos Ghosn, who has always cooperated with the French justice authorities, is subject to a judicial ban on leaving the Lebanese territory,” he said.

“We believe this move is the only technical resort they found to be able in the future to try the case in a court of law.”

Ghosn, the former chairman and CEO of the auto alliance, was arrested in Japan in 2018 after an internal company investigation alleged “significant acts of misconduct” during his tenure, including accusations that he had understated his income.


The former auto boss has said that he is willing to face trial outside of Japan.

Ghosn confirmed to the BBC in July 2021 that he had left the country on a private plane while hiding inside a box normally used for audio equipment.

“I didn’t leave Japan to hide somewhere,” Ghosn told CNN’s Richard Quest in an interview in January 2020. “I left Japan because I’m looking for justice and I want to clear my name,”

“Freedom, no matter the way it happens, is always sweet,” he added.","Simon Bouvier Xiaofei Xu Chris Liakos Anna Cooban, Simon Bouvier, Xiaofei Xu, Chris Liakos, Anna Cooban",https://cnn.com/2022/04/22/business/carlos-ghosn-french-arrest-warrant/index.html,"https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/220422055908-carlos-ghosn-file-06142021.jpg?c=16x9&q=w_800,c_fill",CNN
Elon Musk's The Boring Company now valued at nearly $5.7 billion,"Washington, DC (CNN) The Boring Company, Elon Musk's bid to beat traffic by putting Teslas in tunnels, has raised $675 million, which it plans to use to build more of its Loop projects.

Loop is a mostlyunderground transportation system that offers point-to-point trips between stations where people board Tesla SUVs. One Loop system is already operating in Las Vegas with three stations and 1.7 miles of tunnel at the Las Vegas Convention Center. There are plans to expand the system throughout the Vegas strip, with 51 stations over 29 miles.

The Boring Company is also developing a project in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and is in conversations with San Antonio, Texas. It's previously announced projects in Chicago, Washington, DC and Los Angeles, but has not completed them. It faced a lawsuit from unhappy Los Angeles neighbors, and fell out of favor when Chicago elected a new mayor.

The US government is taking steps to ensure its data is capturing everyone,"San Francisco (CNN Business) US government data often provides a look at how large swaths of Americans are faring. However, this big-picture approach has often been criticized for leaving out certain groups of people, like Native Americans and members of the LGBTQ+ community, and rendering them practically invisible when it comes to broader policymaking and funding of public services.

Now the Biden administration is working on a plan to ensure fewer people are slipping through the cracks.

On Friday, the Equitable Data Working Group, a collection of data and policy experts from more than a dozen federal agencies, released a blueprint outlining how to make federal data more representative of America's increasing diversity.


Government data is also often considered the gold standard when it comes to determining the distribution of federal, state and local funding for services like veterans benefits, disaster relief and stimulus payments. It can also be used to better analyze how tax credits and other benefits are impacting Americans and to ensure this funding is going to the people who need it the most.

Mortgage rates just hit a 12-year high,"(CNN) Mortgage rates continued to rise this week, reaching their highest level in more than a decade.

The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage averaged 5.11% in the week ending April 21, up from 5% the week before, according to Freddie Mac. It is the seventh consecutive week of increases and is significantly higher than the 2.97% average this time last year.

The last time rates reached this level was in April 2010 when they hit 5.21%, according to Freddie Mac.

""While springtime is typically the busiest home buying season, the upswing in rates has caused some volatility in demand,"" said Sam Khater, Freddie Mac's chief economist. ""It continues to be a seller's market, but buyers who remain interested in purchasing a home may find that competition has moderately softened.""

Buyers have been scrambling to get a home before rates rise too much. Those who weren't able to lock in a lower rate are finding themselves unable to afford the much higher payment on today's homes, said George Ratiu, Realtor.com's manager of economic research. That is starting to show in the sales numbers, with March's existing home sales down 2.7% from February -- even as prices hit an all-time record

CNN+ will shut down at the end of April,"New York CNN Business —

CNN+, the streaming service that was hyped as one of the most significant developments in the history of CNN, will shut down on April 30, just one month after it launched.

CNN+ customers “will receive prorated refunds of subscription fees,” the company said.

The decision was made by new management after CNN’s former parent company, WarnerMedia, merged with Discovery to form Warner Bros. Discovery earlier this month.

The prior management team’s vision for CNN+ runs counter to Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav’s plan to house all of the company’s brands under one streaming service. Some CNN+ programming may eventually live on through that service. Other programming will shift to CNN’s main television network.

“In a complex streaming market, consumers want simplicity and an all-in service which provides a better experience and more value than stand-alone offerings, and, for the company, a more sustainable business model to drive our future investments in great journalism and storytelling,” Discovery’s streaming boss J.B. Perrette said in a statement.

“We have very exciting opportunities ahead in the streaming space and CNN, one of the world’s premier reputational assets, will play an important role there,” Perrette added.

Perrette and incoming CNN CEO Chris Licht notified staffers of the decision in a meeting on Thursday afternoon. Licht bluntly told employees it was a “uniquely shitty situation.”

Hundreds of CNN+ staffers may lose their jobs. Licht said in an internal memo that “all CNN+ employees will continue to be paid and receive benefits for the next 90 days to explore opportunities at CNN, CNN Digital and elsewhere in the Warner Bros. Discovery family.”

Staffers who aren’t absorbed elsewhere in the company will receive a minimum of six months of severance, he added.

An agent for one CNN+ host, who was set to anchor a weekly show on the streaming service, described their client’s program at the network as facing an uncertain future. “It’s all TBD,” the person said.

But the agent added that the network has gone out of its way to make clear that it is committed to finding roles for CNN+ hosts.

Licht said in a town hall style meeting with staffers that “this was an incredibly successful launch” but simply incompatible with the newly merged company’s plans.

“It is not your fault that you had the rug pulled out from underneath you,” he said as he vowed to minimize the impacts to staff.

One CNN+ staffer at the town hall described the sentiment as “total and utter shock” that morphed into despair.



“Some of this was avoidable,” he said, but “prior leadership decided to just keep going” with the planned March launch of CNN+ despite the impending merger, he said.

The streaming service ended up launching just two weeks before the WarnerMedia-Discovery merger completed, much to the exasperation of Discovery leadership, which had a different strategy but could not legally communicate with CNN executives before the deal was official.

Warner Bros. Discovery has billions in debt, much of which is a result of the deal to combine the company, and executives are under pressure to find $3 billion in savings that Wall Street is expecting from them.

The executive vice president in charge of CNN+ and all of CNN’s digital businesses, Andrew Morse, who worked closely with Kilar and Zucker, will depart the company after a transition period.

In a note to employees, Morse described his nine years at CNN as an “incredible ride” and said, “As the company enters an exciting period of change, it’s clear that the vision the new leadership has for the future is different than the one we’ve had. That’s OK. That’s all part of change.”

Licht said in the town hall that he wanted Morse to stay, but respected the decision.

Alex MacCallum, the head of product and general manager of CNN+, will run CNN Digital and work with Licht “to determine a leadership strategy going forward,” the company said in a press release.

On Thursday afternoon, CNN+ employees housed on the 16th floor of Hudson Yards, the network’s New York headquarters, broke out whiskey and wine to commiserate.

The decision to shut down CNN+ just weeks after it launched marked a stunning end to the streaming news service. Executives had touted the application as the most significant launch since Ted Turner founded CNN in 1980.

CNN had poured hundreds of millions of dollars into the new streaming app and lured top talent from other networks for it, including Kasie Hunt from NBC and Chris Wallace from Fox News.

The streaming service featured hours of daily live programming and weekly shows.

Are you a single parent navigating higher costs? Share your story.,"San Francisco (CNN Business) Daily life continues to get more expensive as American households battle the worst inflation in 40 years.

From meat to gas to clothing and housing, the average family now has to fork over hundreds more dollars each month compared to this time last year.

Food prices alone are up almost 9%, leaving many families to make difficult choices at the grocery store. Meanwhile, prices at the pump are up 43% from a year ago.

This has forced many people -- especially those who are solely responsible for their family and finances -- to make sacrifices and cut back where there's often little wiggle room.

Why U-Haul trucks all have Arizona license plates,"New York (CNN Business) There are around 175,000 white and orange U-Haul rental trucks in the United States and Canada for do-it-yourself movers. And they all have something strange in common: Arizona license plates with the word ""apportioned"" slapped on them.

The reason?

An esoteric agreement between the 48 continental US states, Washington DC and all 10 Canadian provinces determining how big-rigs and other commercial vehicles that travel across state lines divvy up billions of dollars of license plate registration fees.

The issue of U-Haul's license plates took on greater significance last week, after investigators in New York City said they were looking for information about a U-Haul van with Arizona plates in connection with a subway shooting that left more than 20 people injured.

License plate fees

When you register your passenger car, you usually pay a small license plate fee to your state DMV that goes to funding roads, bridges and other public infrastructure projects.

But commercial trucking, rental and leasing companies that use big rigs to transport goods through multiple states operate under a completely different system . These vehicles need special permission to travel across state lines and have to pay higher license fees, often upwards of $1,000 a year.

Such vehicles — known as ""apportionable vehicles"" — are registered and licensed under what's known as the International Registration Plan (IRP), an agreement created between states in the 1970s.

The IRP allows commercial trucks traveling within the United States and Canada to use one state-issued license plate and registration card but requires operators to pay fees to other states based on how many miles they drive in them and their weight. Some companies keep track of miles manually while others use GPS systems.

So U-Haul, which has been based in Phoenix since 1967, registers all of its rental trucks in Arizona and the state then distributes those license plate fees to other states where the rental trucks travel.


Amerco UHAL U-Haul, owned by the holding company, does not disclose how much it pays in registration fees annually or which states receive the most cash. But a spokesperson for U-Haul said it paid ""a vast sum of money"" in IRP fees.

No free riders

Although most travelers have never heard of the IRP, it was developed as the interstate travel system expanded.

The agreement eliminated the hassle of trucks having to carrying separate license plates and cab cards for each state they traveled through. It was also designed to ensure that states got a fair share of license plate fees from out-of-state vehicles that were wearing down their roads.

""There are pictures of old trucks with 10 or 12 license plates on the front,"" said Tim Adams, the CEO of International Registration Plan, Inc., an organization that oversees compliance with the agreement.

Around 3 million vehicles and 350,000 companies were part of the IRP in 2021, Adams said. They paid $3.5 billion in fees that were used to fund highway projects and safety initiatives.

""It generates a lot of money for the road funds each year,"" he said. The IRP is a ""fluid agreement that still has purpose.""

In fact, the agreement has worked so effectively that the International Fuel Tax Agreement (IFTA), a similar arrangement between states divvying up commercial vehicles' fuel tax sales, was modeled after it.

So the next time you're playing the license plate game during a road trip and keep passing U-Haul vans with Arizona plates, you can impress your family by explaining why.","Nathaniel Meyersohn, Cnn Business",https://cnn.com/2022/04/23/business/uhaul-rental-trucks-license-plates-arizona/index.html,https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/220420165331-u-haul-trucks-file-super-tease.jpg,CNN
Europe agrees to sweeping new regulations for tech platforms,"(CNN) European policymakers have reached agreement on a sweeping package of new regulations for tech platforms that could mean big changes in oversight for everything from social media algorithms to digital advertising — and with potential ramifications worldwide.

The proposed law, known as the Digital Services Act (DSA) , marks the second piece of landmark tech legislation to advance in Europe within a month. It aims to impose new rules on how the tech industry handles misinformation and illegal content on social media, as well as illegal goods and services on online marketplaces. The biggest companies that violate the law could face billions in fines.

""Today's agreement -- complementing the political agreement on the Digital Markets Act last month -- sends a strong signal: to all Europeans, to all EU businesses, and to our international counterparts,"" said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen.

The draft law marks a potential turning point in tech regulation. It gives officials more tools for removing hate speech, going after e-commerce sellers who promote illegal goods, and scrutinizing the recommendation algorithms of tech platforms, among other things. It applies not only to social media sites but also to app stores, gig economy platforms, and even cloud services and internet providers.

The broad legislation also envisions additional requirements for what it calls ""very large online platforms"" with at least 45 million EU users. For these companies, the law would require content moderation risk assessments and independent audits tied to their handling of illegal material, as well as content that may be legal but still threatens public health, human rights or other public interest priorities.

Netflix may clamp down on password sharing. Here's what that means,"Does this mean the streamer is about to kick millions of viewers off shared accounts? Not quite.

Over half of the new Popeyes locations that are scheduled to open in 2022 will feature double drive-thrus , designed to get customers through the queue faster.

Speedy drive-thru times are very important to fast food restaurants . If a customer gets held up in a Popeyes' line, they might go to a competitor next time — and on the flip side, consistently fast service can drive loyalty. Tech improvements are also coming to Popeyes' kitchens to help employees in the back of the house work more efficiently.

Popeyes is planning to open over 200 new restaurants in the United States and Canada this year.

A handful of the new restaurants will be in New York City, including a new flagship location in Times Square as well as others in Manhattan and Staten Island.

Ukraine war latest news: Apartment block in Odesa hit after city is targeted with rockets,"Azov regiment Copyright: Azov regiment More than 15 children - from babies to teenagers - are sheltering in the bunker, one of the women there says Image caption: More than 15 children - from babies to teenagers - are sheltering in the bunker, one of the women there says

Ukraine's Azov regiment has released a video purportedly showing its fighters bringing food and other aid to women and children sheltering in one of underground bunkers at the Azovstal plant - the last part of Mariupol not under Russian control.

In the footage women and children - seen in a crowded room - can be heard saying they are now running out of food and water, and pleading to be evacuated from the besieged southern city.

A number of those filmed say they have been trapped underground for weeks, with one girl saying she hasn't seen the daylight since 27 February - the fourth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Big signs reading ""Children"" in red paint are seen on the walls of the bunker. One woman is heard saying more than 15 children - from babies to those aged 14 - are sheltering in the building.

The video - believed to be filmed on 21 April - has not been verified by the BBC.

The Azovstal steelworks - a maze of tunnels and workshops - is a huge industrial site in central Mariupol. It's almost like a city within a city.


Much of Mariupol has been destroyed in weeks of heavy Russian bombardment and intense street fighting.

This week, President Vladimir Putin called off a planned Russian assault on the steelworks, and ordered his troops to seal it off instead.

"Live Updates: As Weapons From West Flow In, Zelensky Says Ukraine Better Able to Mount Defense","A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March. The war in Ukraine has stoked fears in Moldova of renewed pressures from Russia.

CHISINAU, Moldova — Before war erupted next door, Moldovans had big plans for their country.


The war jitters are also adding another chapter to Moldova’s long and increasingly desperate effort to untangle itself from Moscow’s clutches. In pursuit of that, it recently applied to join the European Union, but the prospect of gaining admission anytime soon is remote.

“We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” said Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, in an interview.

Moldovans’ fears swelled anew on Friday, when a Russian general said his country’s military now plans to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine. That would establish a land bridge from Russia in the east to Transnistria, a heavily armed, breakaway region in Moldova’s east — bordering Ukraine — that is controlled by Russia.


Whether Russia has the wherewithal to swallow up such a large stretch of Ukrainian territory is debatable, especially in view of the enormous losses its military suffered in the battle for Kyiv. But whether real or just an effort to stir up trouble in the region, the Moldovans are taking the general’s threat seriously.


Tucked between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is tiny — with less than three million people — and for centuries has been torn between greater powers: first the Ottomans and Russia, and now Europe and Russia. The theme, clearly, is Russia, and Russia does not want to let it go.

Moscow exerts a stranglehold over nearly 100 percent of Moldova’s energy supply. And the Kremlin is constantly trying to stir up Moldova’s many Russian speakers who are susceptible to its propaganda, especially in Transnistria.

That is what seemed to have happened on Friday, when, according to the Russian news media, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said, “Russian control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are cases of Russian-speaking people being oppressed.”

The Moldovan government immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about the general’s statement, saying it was “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”

For Ms. Sandu, 49, the country’s first female president, it was another hurdle along a dangerous pathway she has been trying to navigate since the crisis began.

Moldova has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and barred Moldovans from sticking pro-Russia symbols on their cars. At the same time, the country did not fully join the European Union’s sanctions on Russia, for fear of being cut off from Russian gas.

“No one said it was going to be easy,” Ms. Sandu, 49, said from her office on Stefan cel Mare, the grand boulevard in the capital, Chisinau, that cuts past a patchwork of hulking, Soviet-style office buildings. “But no one said it was going to be this hard.”


But now his operations have fallen into peril. Brandy worth a quarter of a million dollars that he needs to ship to Belarus has been blocked in his warehouses. His regular Ukrainian customers have no way of paying him, costing him several more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he cannot ship his chardonnays to China, one of his new markets, because the port in Odesa, Ukraine, that he uses for exports shut down as soon as the first bombs fell in February.

“I don’t know what to do,” said Mr. Trofim, who may soon have to lay off almost half of his staff. “Everything is frozen until we understand how to live with this situation.”


Prices for basic goods then shot up as supply chains were disrupted. And business owners had to persuade their employees, terrified that the war might cross into Moldova, not to flee the country, following the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who moved abroad in the past decade.

“We were already considered a high risk,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moldova. “We had just started convincing investors to take a shot on us. Now everyone has backed out.”

It is not all bad news. Some Ukrainian companies are considering moving to Moldova, in search of a safer environment. And with all of the foreign dignitaries (and news crews) swooping in, its international profile has received a lift, leading the government last month to rebrand Moldova as “a small country with a big heart.”

Many Russians discovered that big heart long ago. During Soviet times, retired officers flocked to Moldova, drawn by the scenery, good food and sunshine. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the country was run by pro-Russian elites, who kept strong links with Moscow, especially regarding energy.


Image Moldova relies on Russian companies for all of its natural gas supplies, making it vulnerable to pressure from Moscow. Credit... Cristian Movila for The New York Times

And so Russia continues to use its sway over gas prices to push Moldova around. Russia has intimated, for instance, that it would lower prices if Moldova agreed to make concessions on Transnistria, which Moldova has refused.

Moldova’s twin problems, of energy and Transnistria, are interconnected. In the Soviet era, Moldova’s biggest power plant, and its two biggest gas-pumping stations, were built in Transnistria.

“If you look at the map, it doesn’t make sense,” said Victor Parlicov, an energy analyst and a former government official. “It was built this way in case Moldova would try to pursue its own path.”

Transnistria has its own flag, complete with a Soviet-style hammer and sickle, and a separate identity from the rest of Moldova. Its roots go back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union carved out a small republic in the same area, before incorporating parts of it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during World War II.” Mr. Parlicov said that this fit a pattern of the Soviet authorities reshaping the borders of republics against historical realities, which created the potential for conflict.

Transnistria’s situation mirrors that of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists rebelled after the anti-Russian 2014 rebellion, setting off a chain of events that led to war. Transnistria also complicates Moldova’s aspirations to join the European Union.

“We’d be happy to be part of the E.U.,” said Serghei Diaconu, the deputy interior minister. But, he added, half-jokingly, Transnistria was “a big pain” that could discourage the E.U. from accepting Moldova.

Joining NATO would be an even taller order. Neutrality is enshrined in Moldova’s constitution, a holdover from the early 1990s, when it tried to stand on its own without antagonizing Russia. Now, Moldova’s leaders are questioning the wisdom of that approach.

“If you ask me whether neutrality is going to keep us safe, I don’t know,” said Ms. Sandu, the president. “It did not help over the last three decades to convince Russia to take its troops out of the country.”

The geopolitical tightrope the country is forced to walk, in the eyes of many Moldovans, means its future is intertwined with Russia’s. Mr. Trofim, the winemaker, for one, said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

Warsaw’s Welcome Mat Risks Fraying Under Strain of a New Refugee Surge,"WARSAW — Warsaw’s biggest pediatric hospital has put patients from Ukraine on its waiting list for liver transplants, sometimes ahead of Polish children. Schools in Poland’s capital have had to search for extra teachers to keep up with the influx of new pupils. Public transport has risked buckling under the strain of so many new residents.

Yet, to just about everyone’s surprise, Warsaw has kept working, defying predictions of a breakdown and an angry public backlash. The city, which has welcomed hundreds of thousands of fleeing refugees, has decked itself with Ukrainian flags and banners of support for Poland’s war-ravaged eastern neighbor.

But just as the tsunami of refugees, which increased the capital’s population by nearly 20 percent in just a few weeks, seemed to be receding, Warsaw’s mayor, Rafal Trzaskowski, is now bracing for a possible new influx as Russia’s military pushes to achieve what President Vladimir V.

The Former Chancellor Who Became Putin’s Man in Germany,"“He took advantage of the reputation and influence of the chancellor’s office and offered himself up as an agent for Russian interests to get rich,” said Norbert Röttgen, a conservative lawmaker, former minister and longtime Russia hawk.

In the interviews, Mr. Schröder, now 78, spoke with undiminished swagger, cracking jokes but arguing in essence that, well, if he got rich, then so did his country. When it came to Russian gas, everyone was on board, he pointed out, mocking his detractors over copious amounts of white wine.

“They all went along with it for the last 30 years,” he said. “But suddenly everyone knows better.”

Mr. Schröder scoffed at the notion of now distancing himself personally from Mr. Putin, 69, whom he considers a friend and sees regularly, most recently last month in an informal effort to help end the Ukraine war.

Hackers Claim to Target Russian Institutions in Barrage of Cyberattacks and Leaks,"Hackers claim to have broken into dozens of Russian institutions over the past two months, including the Kremlin’s internet censor and one of its primary intelligence services, leaking emails and internal documents to the public in an apparent hack-and-leak campaign that is remarkable in its scope.


Much of the data released by the hackers and the Ukrainian government is by its nature impossible to verify. As an intelligence agency, the F.S.B. would never confirm a list of its officers. Even the groups distributing the data have warned that the files swiped from Russian institutions could contain malware, manipulated or faked information, and other tripwires.

"Live Updates: As Weapons From West Flow In, Zelensky Says Ukraine Better Able to Mount Defense","A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March. The war in Ukraine has stoked fears in Moldova of renewed pressures from Russia.

CHISINAU, Moldova — Before war erupted next door, Moldovans had big plans for their country.


The war jitters are also adding another chapter to Moldova’s long and increasingly desperate effort to untangle itself from Moscow’s clutches. In pursuit of that, it recently applied to join the European Union, but the prospect of gaining admission anytime soon is remote.

“We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” said Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, in an interview.

Moldovans’ fears swelled anew on Friday, when a Russian general said his country’s military now plans to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine. That would establish a land bridge from Russia in the east to Transnistria, a heavily armed, breakaway region in Moldova’s east — bordering Ukraine — that is controlled by Russia.


Whether Russia has the wherewithal to swallow up such a large stretch of Ukrainian territory is debatable, especially in view of the enormous losses its military suffered in the battle for Kyiv. But whether real or just an effort to stir up trouble in the region, the Moldovans are taking the general’s threat seriously.


Tucked between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is tiny — with less than three million people — and for centuries has been torn between greater powers: first the Ottomans and Russia, and now Europe and Russia. The theme, clearly, is Russia, and Russia does not want to let it go.

Moscow exerts a stranglehold over nearly 100 percent of Moldova’s energy supply. And the Kremlin is constantly trying to stir up Moldova’s many Russian speakers who are susceptible to its propaganda, especially in Transnistria.

That is what seemed to have happened on Friday, when, according to the Russian news media, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said, “Russian control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are cases of Russian-speaking people being oppressed.”

The Moldovan government immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about the general’s statement, saying it was “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”

For Ms. Sandu, 49, the country’s first female president, it was another hurdle along a dangerous pathway she has been trying to navigate since the crisis began.

Moldova has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and barred Moldovans from sticking pro-Russia symbols on their cars. At the same time, the country did not fully join the European Union’s sanctions on Russia, for fear of being cut off from Russian gas.

“No one said it was going to be easy,” Ms. Sandu, 49, said from her office on Stefan cel Mare, the grand boulevard in the capital, Chisinau, that cuts past a patchwork of hulking, Soviet-style office buildings. “But no one said it was going to be this hard.”


But now his operations have fallen into peril. Brandy worth a quarter of a million dollars that he needs to ship to Belarus has been blocked in his warehouses. His regular Ukrainian customers have no way of paying him, costing him several more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he cannot ship his chardonnays to China, one of his new markets, because the port in Odesa, Ukraine, that he uses for exports shut down as soon as the first bombs fell in February.

“I don’t know what to do,” said Mr. Trofim, who may soon have to lay off almost half of his staff. “Everything is frozen until we understand how to live with this situation.”


Prices for basic goods then shot up as supply chains were disrupted. And business owners had to persuade their employees, terrified that the war might cross into Moldova, not to flee the country, following the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who moved abroad in the past decade.

“We were already considered a high risk,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moldova. “We had just started convincing investors to take a shot on us. Now everyone has backed out.”

It is not all bad news. Some Ukrainian companies are considering moving to Moldova, in search of a safer environment. And with all of the foreign dignitaries (and news crews) swooping in, its international profile has received a lift, leading the government last month to rebrand Moldova as “a small country with a big heart.”

Many Russians discovered that big heart long ago. During Soviet times, retired officers flocked to Moldova, drawn by the scenery, good food and sunshine. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the country was run by pro-Russian elites, who kept strong links with Moscow, especially regarding energy.

And so Russia continues to use its sway over gas prices to push Moldova around. Russia has intimated, for instance, that it would lower prices if Moldova agreed to make concessions on Transnistria, which Moldova has refused.

Moldova’s twin problems, of energy and Transnistria, are interconnected. In the Soviet era, Moldova’s biggest power plant, and its two biggest gas-pumping stations, were built in Transnistria.

“If you look at the map, it doesn’t make sense,” said Victor Parlicov, an energy analyst and a former government official. “It was built this way in case Moldova would try to pursue its own path.”

Transnistria has its own flag, complete with a Soviet-style hammer and sickle, and a separate identity from the rest of Moldova. Its roots go back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union carved out a small republic in the same area, before incorporating parts of it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during World War II.” Mr. Parlicov said that this fit a pattern of the Soviet authorities reshaping the borders of republics against historical realities, which created the potential for conflict.

Transnistria’s situation mirrors that of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists rebelled after the anti-Russian 2014 rebellion, setting off a chain of events that led to war. Transnistria also complicates Moldova’s aspirations to join the European Union.

“We’d be happy to be part of the E.U.,” said Serghei Diaconu, the deputy interior minister. But, he added, half-jokingly, Transnistria was “a big pain” that could discourage the E.U. from accepting Moldova.

Joining NATO would be an even taller order. Neutrality is enshrined in Moldova’s constitution, a holdover from the early 1990s, when it tried to stand on its own without antagonizing Russia. Now, Moldova’s leaders are questioning the wisdom of that approach.

“If you ask me whether neutrality is going to keep us safe, I don’t know,” said Ms. Sandu, the president. “It did not help over the last three decades to convince Russia to take its troops out of the country.”

The geopolitical tightrope the country is forced to walk, in the eyes of many Moldovans, means its future is intertwined with Russia’s. Mr. Trofim, the winemaker, for one, said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

"Meadows Was Warned Jan. 6 Could Turn Violent, House Panel Says","Ms. Hutchinson told investigators that she heard lawyers from the White House Counsel’s Office say the plan for alternate electors was not “legally sound,” according to the filing.

“The select committee’s filing today urges the court to reject Mark Meadows’s baseless claims and put an end to his obstruction of our investigation,” the leaders of the committee, Representatives Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi, and Liz Cheney, Republican of Wyoming, said in a statement. “Mr. Meadows is hiding behind broad claims of executive privilege even though much of the information we’re seeking couldn’t possibly be covered by privilege and courts have rejected similar claims because the committee’s interest in getting to the truth is so compelling.”

A lawyer for Mr. Meadows did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The committee issued a subpoena in November to Ms. Hutchinson, who served as special assistant to the president for legislative affairs and was at the White House on Jan. 6 and with Mr. Trump when he spoke at the “Stop the Steal” rally that day. She also reached out directly to Georgia officials about Mr. Meadows’s trip to that state.

She was present for key meetings and discussions in the White House in the buildup to Jan. 6.

Ms. Hutchinson also told the panel that top White House lawyers had threatened to resign over extreme plans to seize voting machines, and that had helped persuade Mr. Meadows to back off that plan. “Once it became clear that there would be mass resignations, including lawyers in the White House Counsel’s Office, including some of the staff that Mr. Meadows worked closely with, you know, I know that did factor into his thinking,” she said.

And she said members of Congress had urged a crowd to amass at the Capitol on Jan. 6.

One investigator asked her whether Representative Scott Perry, Republican of Pennsylvania, who is now the head of the right-wing House Freedom Caucus, supported “the idea of sending people to the Capitol on January the 6th.”

“He did,” Ms. Hutchinson replied.

The panel also emphasized how personally involved Mr. Meadows was in attempts to pressure Brad Raffensperger, the Georgia secretary of state, over Mr. Trump’s loss there — so much so that Mr. Raffensperger ducked and ignored his phone calls, viewing them as improper.

“‘Yeah, Mark Meadows called. The president wants to talk to you,’” Mr. Raffensperger recalled an aide telling him. “I don’t want to do that. And just tell him, you know, we’re just not interested in doing that.”","Luke Broadwater, Alan Feuer",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/us/politics/mark-meadows-jan-6-trump.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/us/politics/22dc-meadows/22dc-meadows-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes
McCarthy Said Trump Acknowledged ‘Some Responsibility’ for Jan. 6,"Representative Kevin McCarthy, the House Republican leader, told G.O.P. lawmakers in the days after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol that former President Donald J. Trump acknowledged he bore “some responsibility” for what happened that day, new audio revealed on Friday.

The audio obtained by The New York Times is part of a series of revelations about Republican leaders’ private condemnations of Mr. Trump in the days after his supporters stormed the Capitol.

Mr. McCarthy’s assertion would be the clearest indication yet that Mr. Trump may have admitted some measure of culpability for the deadly mob. The revelation comes as congressional investigators scour for evidence of Mr. Trump’s involvement in his supporters’ failed attempt to block the official certification of his loss in the 2020 election.

“Let me be very clear to all of you, and I have been very clear to the president: He bears responsibilities for his words and actions,” Mr. McCarthy told House Republicans on a Jan. 11 conference call. “No if, ands or buts.”","Jonathan Martin, Alexander Burns, Neil Vigdor",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/22/us/politics/mccarthy-trump-jan-6-recording.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/multimedia/22pol-jan6gop-mccarthy/22pol-jan6gop-mccarthy-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes
The Drive to Vaccinate the World Against Covid Is Losing Steam,"Fewer than 17 percent of Africans have received a primary Covid immunization. Nearly half of the vaccine doses delivered to the continent thus far have gone unused. Last month, the number of doses injected on the continent fell by 35 percent compared to February. W.H.O. officials attributed the drop to mass vaccination pushes being replaced by smaller-scale campaigns in several countries.

Some global health experts say the world missed a prime opportunity last year to provide vaccines to lower-income countries, when the public was more fearful of Covid and motivated to get vaccinated.


What momentum remains in the global vaccination campaign has been hindered by a shortfall in funding for the equipment, transportation and personnel needed to get shots into arms.

In the United States, a key funder of the vaccination effort, lawmakers stripped $5 billion meant for global pandemic aid from the coronavirus response package that is expected to come up for a vote in the next few weeks. Biden administration officials have said that without the funds, they will be unable to provide support for vaccine delivery to more than 20 under-vaccinated countries.

Some public health experts point to reasons for optimism that the global vaccination campaign still has steam. Despite the drop off from the February peak, the number of Covid vaccinations being administered each day in Africa is still near a pandemic high. And Gavi earlier this month drew a significant new round of funding pledges, securing $4.8 billion in commitments, although it fell short of its $5.2 billion goal.","Rebecca Robbins, Stephanie Nolen",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/covid-vaccines-world-africa.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/science/00virus-vaccination-target1/00virus-vaccination-target1-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes

About the data

Data for all countries except the United States comes from the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University. United States data comes from state and local health officials and is collected by The New York Times. Population data from the World Bank and U.S. Census Bureau. Data for some countries, like the United States, Denmark, France and the Netherlands, include counts for overseas territories. The New York Times has found that official tallies in more than thirty countries have undercounted deaths during the coronavirus outbreak because of limited testing availability. The Times has identified reporting anomalies or methodology changes in the data. More about reporting anomalies or changes March 21, 2022: Chile added probable Covid-19 deaths from earlier in the pandemic.

Governments often revise data or report a single-day large increase in cases or deaths from unspecified days without historical revisions, which can cause an irregular pattern in the daily reported figures. The Times is excluding these anomalies from seven-day averages when possible. For agencies that do not report data every day, variation in the schedule on which cases or deaths are reported, such as around holidays, can also cause an irregular pattern in averages. The Times uses an adjustment method to vary the number of days included in an average to remove these irregularities.",The New York Times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/world/covid-cases.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2021/01/17/us/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1610933157013/china-wuhan-coronavirus-maps-promo-1610933157013-facebookJumbo-v907.png,NYTimes

Vaccine doses remain relatively scarce globally. But concerns around waning immunity have prompted many countries, including the United States and Israel, to start administering additional doses.

Less wealthy countries are relying on a vaccine-sharing arrangement called Covax, which originally aimed to provide two billion doses by the end of 2021 but repeatedly cut its forecasts because of production problems, export bans and vaccine hoarding by wealthy nations.

Coach’s Prayers Prompt Supreme Court Test of Religious Freedom,"“He said the same thing to me,” Mr. Peterson said. “I said it may not have been explicit coercion, but there was an implicit coercion. When the coach goes out to the 50-yard line, he has something to say.”

Over the last 60 years, the Supreme Court has rejected prayer in public schools, at least when it was officially required or part of a formal ceremony like a high school graduation. As recently as 2000, the court ruled that organized prayers led by students at high school football games violated the First Amendment’s prohibition of government establishment of religion.

“The delivery of a pregame prayer has the improper effect of coercing those present to participate in an act of religious worship,” Justice John Paul Stevens wrote for the majority.

Mr. Kennedy’s lawyers said those school prayer precedents were not relevant because they involved government speech. Rather, they said, the core question in Mr. Kennedy’s case is whether government employees give up their rights to free speech and the free exercise of religion at the workplace.

The school district, its lawyers responded, was entitled to require Mr. Kennedy to stop praying as he had. “Regardless of whether Kennedy’s very public speech was official, the district could regulate it,” the school district’s Supreme Court brief said. “His prayer practice wrested control from the district over the district’s own events, interfered with students’ religious freedom and subjected the district to substantial litigation risks.”

The sweep of the Supreme Court’s decision may turn on which side’s characterization of the facts it accepts. But even a modest ruling in Mr. Kennedy’s favor, saying that his private, solitary prayer was protected even if it took place in public and at least tacitly invited students to participate, would represent a sea change in the court’s approach to the role religion may play in public schools.

Mr. Kennedy was born in Bremerton, which is just across the Puget Sound from Seattle but in some ways worlds away. “Friday nights at the Bremerton High School football field were small-town Americana kind of events,” Mr. Peterson said.",Adam Liptak,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/us/supreme-court-football-coach-prayer.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/12/us/politics/00dc-coach-1/merlin_203446359_060dd701-fbad-473e-952e-c65d96afe3ac-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes

Why the Road Is Getting Even Rockier for First-Time Home Buyers,"Local officials are exploring ways to give people like Ms. Wilkes a fighting chance at homeownership, like buying land and offering it for below market value, and creating legislation to add barriers to corporate ownership. But no specific policies have been proposed.

Efforts to curtail the spread of corporate homeownership are slow going at the federal level, too. A Senate bill that would close legal, tax and regulatory loopholes “that allow private equity firms to capture all the rewards of their investments while insulating themselves from risk” has sat in committee since Senators Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio and others introduced it in October.

In the meantime, many home buyers feel like their last hope is a stroke of luck.

On her route as a mail carrier, Ashlee Floyd would take photos of for sale signs to search for the listings on breaks, only to find one after another listed for outside her $300,000 budget. Offers she made on five houses were rejected.

Ms. Floyd scrimped for a higher down payment — cutting back on Christmas gifts and extracurricular activities for her two children — and picked up as much overtime as she could, often working 65 hour weeks.

Two years after she began her search, she found a home she could afford in a quiet subdivision in northwest Charlotte and an owner who was committed to selling to a family, not a company. Last week, she closed, paying $292,000, $27,000 over the asking price.

“It’s over, the nightmare is over,” Ms. Floyd said. “We just have a foundation now. This is where we’re going to plant our seed and grow from here. That’s how it feels.”",Sophie Kasakove,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/us/corporate-real-estate-investors-housing-market.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/us/23INVESTOR-LANDLORD-top-opt/23INVESTOR-LANDLORD-top-opt-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes
"The End of the All-Male, All-White Cockpit","Then the university called off its partnership with the flight school, making it difficult for Ms. Percy to get the pilot training she needed in time to graduate, so she switched to a concentration in aviation management. It wasn’t until she arrived at the Lt. Col. Luke Weathers Jr. Flight Academy, which was started by the Organization of Black Aerospace Professionals, in May 2020 that she began flight training in earnest. Now, Ms. Percy expects to receive her airline pilot certification within a year, with plans to pursue a Ph.D after that.

While flight school can be expensive, the payoff is improving. There were an estimated 164,000 certified active airline pilots in the U.S. last year, slightly fewer than there were in 2019, according to the Federal Aviation Administration. Desperate airlines looking to staff up have started offering early-career pilots higher salaries, bigger bonuses and better schedules. A student can earn a six-figure salary within a decade of graduating, sometimes much sooner, and a senior pilot at a major airline can easily earn several hundred thousand dollars per year. But the price is still daunting, especially in an industry that seems to swing so easily between good times and bad.

Historically, the armed forces offered a less-expensive path into the field. But the military has long struggled with pilot diversity and shortages, too. Still, the Air Force has slowly improved diversity among active duty pilots: Today, about 8 percent of those pilots are women and about 13 percent are nonwhite. While nowhere near reflective of the American public, those figures are still better than the numbers for commercial airlines.

But the reason for racial inequality among pilots that is most commonly cited by experts and instructors is perhaps the most apparent: A lack of role models and exposure has played a central role in keeping many women and people of color out the field.

The Tennessee Law Making School Board Culture Wars Even Worse - The New York Times,"Jim Garrett is the chair of the Davidson County Republican Party, which is holding primaries for its candidates running for the Metropolitan Nashville school board. Nashville is among Tennessee’s bluer regions, where Democrats have an electoral edge. Even so, with the new system, he says, more Republicans are running, and they are raising more money. “It looks like the cost of a campaign is going to be about double what it used to be,” he estimates.

The local G.O.P. is also investing more in these races. For the first time, Davidson Republicans are arranging training sessions for school board candidates. These races weren’t a focus in previous elections, says Mr. Garrett. “They are a focus now.”

There hasn’t yet been special training on the Democratic side. But the county party is happy to connect candidates to campaign vendors and other resources, says its chairwoman, Tara Houston. The party has also tasked a special committee to come up with a platform outlining its basic values on public education, which Democratic school board hopefuls will be expected to support.

In Williamson County, where having a D next to one’s name is a scarlet letter of sorts, most of the primary action has been on the Republican side. In multiple districts, more conventional conservatives are facing off against contenders from the party’s Trumpier wing. Outside groups have lined up behind their champions, providing financial and other support. The most prominent of these is Williamson Families, a political action committee dedicated to protecting the county’s “conservative roots” and “Judeo-Christian values.” The PAC is led by Robin Steenman, who also heads the local branch of Moms for Liberty, a nonprofit based in Florida that champions parental rights and “liberty-minded” leaders nationwide. Williamson Families has endorsed a slate of superconservatives — after weeding out the RINOs, of course.

Multiple parents and teachers in Williamson complain that, as predicted, some of the campaigns and contenders seem focused less on concrete education issues than on culture-war talking points. One middle-school teacher vents to me that some candidates are bragging about their love of Donald Trump and decrying the decline of traditional families and the godlessness of today’s youth.

Meagan Gillis, whose two young daughters attend county schools, says the whole situation has turned to “chaos.” She points to a social media post by a conservative candidate promoting the child furries myth: the wacky online claim that teachers are being forced to cater to students who identify as cats, to the point of putting litter boxes in classrooms and meowing at the children. “I’m like, are you kidding me?” Ms. Gillis marvels. Things are getting so absurd, she says, that her family is seriously considering moving out of the area.

Similar concerns and complaints can be heard from other corners of the state. Virginia Babb has loved her time on the Knox County school board and was planning to run for re-election — until the shift to partisan races. Now she will step down at the end of her term rather than get sucked into the slime. She initially ran for the board as “a very involved parent” without strong partisan leanings, she tells me, noting: “I don’t like either party. They are too much controlled by their extremes.”",Michelle Cottle,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/opinion/school-boards-books-tennessee.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/24/opinion/sunday/23cottle/23cottle-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes
"Opinion | Welcome to the Disorderly, Dangerous World of Expensive Oil and Gas","Look to the Mediterranean, for an example. Europe’s decoupling from Russia will intensify the geopolitical tensions over gas around the sea. In the eastern Mediterranean, Turkey resents its exclusion from energy projects and has been increasingly confrontational in asserting its interests. When Turkey struck a deal with Libya in November 2019 to claim new maritime economic boundaries for itself in the eastern Mediterranean, European Union leaders denounced the agreement as a violation of Greek and Cypriot sovereignty and incompatible with United Nations law. Now the route for a pipeline to bring eastern Mediterranean gas to Europe is causing tensions, not just between Turkey and its neighbors, but also within NATO.

On the other side of the Mediterranean, Algeria is another potential energy source for Europe. But this, too, comes with geopolitical complications: The state-owned Algerian energy firm Sonatrach announced last month it might increase gas prices to Spain after Madrid withdrew support for Algeria in mid-March over the longstanding dispute between Algeria and Morocco over the Western Sahara.

Less Russia also means more trouble in the Middle East. Without Russian help, another Iran nuclear deal becomes less likely, even as Moscow’s war amplifies all of Mr. Biden’s incentives to restore Iran’s energy exports. Rather than breaking with Russia, Arab oil producers appear to have doubled down on OPEC Plus, the world’s new oil cartel with an implicit anti-American bent. The shale boom forced Saudi Arabia to seek wider alliances, including with Russia. Now, as tensions between Russia and Saudi Arabia over Syria and Yemen lessen, the Saudis will prioritize managing their competition with Russia over China — the world’s largest oil export market — and the two states’ shared interests in a nondollar payment system.

It’s not just international politics that are being shaped by the sustainability of present energy consumption. Domestic politics are being shaken up, too.


But the reality is, as Robert Habeck, Germany’s vice chancellor and economic minister, acknowledged before departing for a trip to gas-rich Qatar last month, there is no “value-based” fossil fuel energy strategy for European countries other than importing all their energy from the United States, Canada or Australia, which is impossible.

In Europe, an innocence about energy has been shredded and won’t readily be restored. There, the Western political taboo about talking about reducing energy consumption by means other than greater efficiency is morally exhausted. It remains to be seen whether in the United States, ghosts of President Jimmy Carter’s failed exhortations for sacrifices to personal comfort (wearing sweaters indoors, for instance) as a way to restore American energy independence will prove any less fleeting. Thanks to shale, the United States is the world’s largest oil and gas producer, rendering the country’s energy politics vastly different from that in most European countries, where foreign-energy dependency has been an uncomfortable fact of life for more than a century.",Helen Thompson,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/opinion/oil-gas-energy-prices-russia-ukraine.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/opinion/23thompson/23thompson-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes
"Ukraine: Russians try to storm Mariupol plant, strike Odesa","KYIV, Ukraine (AP) — Russian forces in Ukraine tried to storm a steel plant housing soldiers and civilians in the southern city of Mariupol on Saturday while attempting to crush the last corner of resistance in a location of high symbolic and strategic value to Moscow, Ukrainian officials said.

The reported assault on the eve of Orthodox Easter came after the Kremlin claimed its military had seized all of Mariupol except for the Azovstal plant and as Russia's military pounded other cities and towns in southern and eastern Ukraine. Officials reported that Russia fired at least six cruise missiles at the Black Sea port city of Odesa, killing five people.

The fate of the Ukrainians holed up in the sprawling seaside steel mill wasn’t immediately clear; earlier Saturday, a Ukrainian military unit released a video reportedly taken two days earlier in which women and children holed up underground, some for as long as two months, said they longed to see the sun.


As the battle for shattered Mariupol ground on, Russia claimed it had taken control of several villages elsewhere in the eastern Donbas region and destroyed 11 military Ukrainian military targets overnight, including three artillery warehouses.

Associated Press journalists also observed shelling in residential areas of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and in Sloviansk, a town in northern Donbas. The AP witnessed two soldiers arriving at the town's hospital, one of them fatally wounded. , while a small group of people gathered outside a church where a priest prayed and sprinkled them with water on Holy Saturday.

While British officials said the Russians hadn’t gained significant new ground, Ukrainian officials announced a nationwide curfew ahead of Easter Sunday, a sign of the war’s disruption and threat to the entire country.

Story continues


Occupying Mariupol would deprive the Ukrainians of a vital port, free up Russian troops to fight elsewhere and allow Russia to create a land corridor with the Crimean Peninsula, which Moscow seized from Ukraine in 2014.

An advisor to Ukraine's presidential office, Oleksiy Arestovich, said during a Saturday briefing that Russian forces had resumed air strikes on the Azovstal plant and were trying to storm it. A direct attempt to take the plant would represent a reversal from an order Russian President Vladimir Putin gave two days earlier.


Ukrainian officials have estimated that about 2,000 of their troops are inside the plant along with the civilians sheltering in the facility’s underground tunnels. Arestovic said the Ukrainian forces were trying to counter the new attacks.



The footage of Azovstal showed soldiers giving sweets to children who respond with fist-bumps. One young girl says she and her relatives “haven’t seen neither the sky, nor the sun” since they left home on Feb. 27.

More than 100,000 people — down from a prewar population of about 430,000 — are believed trapped in Mariupol with little food, water or heat, according to Ukrainian authorities, who estimate that over 20,000 civilians have been killed in city during the nearly two-month siege.

Satellite images released this week showed what appeared to be a second mass grave near Mariupol, and local officials accused Russia of burying thousands of civilians to conceal the slaughter taking place there.

The Kremlin hasn’t responded to the satellite images.

In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy denounced all the war's casualties, noting that the Easter holiday commemorates Christ’s resurrection after his death by crucifixion.

“We believe in the victory, of life over death,” he said. “No matter how fierce the battles are, there is no chance for death to defeat life. Everyone knows that. Every Christian knows that.”

Ukrainian officials had said they were trying again Saturday to evacuate women, children and older adults from Mariupol after many previous attempts failed. Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said on the messaging app Telegram that the effort was to get underway at midday, but it wasn’t clear how the new assault on the plant would affect any possible evacuation.

Russian state TV showed the flag of the pro-Moscow Donetsk separatists raised on what it said was the city’s highest point, its TV tower. It also showed what it said was the main building at in flames.


“Residents of the city heard explosions in different areas,” Gerashchenko wrote in a Telegram post. “Residential buildings were hit. It is already known about one victim. He burned in his car in a courtyard of one of the buildings.”

The Ukraine presidential chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, later reported that a 3-month-old baby was among the five people killed in the missile attack.

In the Donbas, Luhansk Gov. Serhiy Haidai said Saturday that two people were killed by Russian shelling in the city of Popasna. Separately, Kharkiv regional governor Oleh Synehubov reported that two people were killed and 19 more wounded by the Russian shelling.

Synehubov said that over the past day, the Russian forces fired at the region’s civilian infrastructure 56 times. Fierce Ukrainian counterattacks nonetheless slowed the Russian offensive in the east, Ukrainian and British officials said Saturday.

Russia still has not established air or sea control due to Ukrainian resistance, and despite Putin’s declaration of victory in Mariupol, “heavy fighting continues to take place, frustrating Russian attempts to capture the city, thus further slowing their desired progress in the Donbas,” the U.K. Ministry of Defense said.

Fan throws beer can at Cody Bellinger at Dodgers-Padres game,"Petco Park saw an ugly moment, courtesy of one fan, in Friday's game between the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Diego Padres.

In the sixth inning, Padres second baseman Jake Cronenworth hit a long fly ball that was caught by Cody Bellinger near the warning track. Before Bellinger turned to throw the ball back in, what appeared to be a beer can flew onto the field in Bellinger's direction.

Both Bellinger and left fielder Chris Taylor noticed the can, with Taylor looking back into the stands. A number of fans also turned trying to identify the thrower of the can.

It remains unclear if the fan was identified or escorted out.

The incident was a minor blip, but still a bad look, in what would eventually be a 6-1 Dodgers win thanks to home runs from Mookie Betts and Max Muncy, plus a three-run rally in the seventh inning.

The beer can wasn't the only negative fan activity at the game, as a two vs. two fistfight broke out on a right field concourse as well.

The win improved the Dodgers' record to an MLB-best 10-3, while the Padres fell to fourth place in the NL West at 9-6.",,https://yahoo.com/sports/cody-bellinger-beer-can-dodgers-padres-petco-park-054813996.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/d51y_iBILouv.iYQRbtS2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/9218cf70-c2c8-11ec-be34-84db39d5da88,Yahoo
Johnny Depp's testimony against Amber Heard analyzed by legal experts: 'Heart-wrenching',"Johnny Depp testified this week in his defamation case against Amber Heard, accusing the actress of emotional and physical abuse during their four-year relationship. It's been wild, to say the least.

In one shocking moment, the Aquaman star, who has yet to take the stand, berated and admitted to ""hitting"" Depp in an audio recording played to the court. Photos were shown of injuries Depp purportedly sustained after violent fights. But there were several uncomfortable moments for the Pirates of the Caribbean star, too. During cross-examination, Depp was faced with aggressive secret recordings taken by Heard. The jury also heard many of the actor's explicit text messages, where he called Heard things like ""worthless hooker"" and ""c***,"" and said he wants to ""f*** her burnt corpse.""

The trial is expected to last several more weeks. While Heard has yet to testify, legal experts believe Depp, so far, is ""winning in the court of public opinion.""

""Johnny has demonstrated that Amber was the dominant aggressor in the relationship which included acts of physical violence against him. He described how she threw a bottle of vodka at him which severed the tip of his finger, that she snubbed out a lit cigarette on his face and punched him in the face. He showed photographs of these injuries,"" family attorney Chris Melcher, a partner of Walzer Melcher, tells Yahoo Entertainment. (Heard maintains it was Depp who cut off the tip of his finger.) ""But the case is not about whether Amber hit Johnny.""

Depp is suing Heard for defamation for describing herself as a ""public figure representing domestic abuse"" in a 2018 op-ed for the Washington Post. He is not suing her for assault.

""Johnny needs to prove that she made a false statement about him in the Washington Post piece. He did not do a good job pointing out specific statements in the article that he believes are false,"" Melcher continues. ""Amber did not directly say in the article that Johnny hit her. She portrayed herself as a victim of domestic violence and claimed that she faced backlash when she spoke up about it. Amber placed herself in a false light but that may not be enough to count as defamation.""

Story continues

Depp lost a similar libel case in the U.K. in 2020, when a judge ruled it was ""substantially true"" the actor abused Heard, therefore it was fair for The Sun to refer to him as a ""wife beater."" The three-week trial was equally as explosive, but Melcher notes there is a key difference.

""The case against The Sun did not involve Amber as a party, she was a witness only, so he was unable to go into depth as to her conduct at that trial as he is able to do now. Johnny explained that he lost his reputation immediately because Amber's accusations created a firestorm of media attention, and that he was advised by his counsel at the time not to fight back,"" Melcher says. ""It is a difficult situation for any public figure to deal with accusations like that, with their counsel advising them to remain silent while the accusations circulate in the media. Six years later, he is finally speaking out in a courtroom with evidence and demonstrating that these allegations are false.""

Melcher adds, ""Johnny is winning in the court of public opinion, even if he loses in the court of Virginia. He must know the chances of winning the defamation case is difficult, and is probably using this case as a forum to expose what Amber did to him. This is the first opportunity he has had to put Amber on trial.""

""Johnny's reputation as a bad-boy and partier actually helps him. His drug use is widely known so it's not like his testimony took anyone by surprise. What may not have been as widely known is the abusive childhood and environment Johnny grew up in. This allowed him to be portrayed as a victim and endear himself to the public and maybe even to the jury,"" Lewis adds. ""But we've got a long way to go. Amber hasn't told her side of the story and, let's keep in mind, both of them are actors and you would expect them to star in their current role of witness.""

A source close to Heard disagrees with how Depp came a cross on the stand, telling Yahoo Entertainment the actor contradicted himself multiple times, especially when it came to his substance abuse issues. The insider emphasizes that the actor has to prove by preponderance of the evidence that he did not abuse Heard in the defamation case and doesn't believe the case was made. That will be up to the jury to decide.

Melcher believes Depp did well during cross-examination in comparison to his first day testifying and appeared ""more comfortable."" He also points out the actor's testimony about his childhood.

""Johnny did a great job explaining how he suffered abuse as a child by his mother and that he withdrew and started using drugs at a young age as a result. It was heart-wrenching to hear how poorly he was treated by his parents and how that led him to self-medicate with drugs at an early age because he had no other way of coping. This was vital testimony to show that Johnny used drugs to numb his pain, rather than to party,"" Melcher says. ""It also demonstrated that Johnny withdraws from conflict because that is what he learned as a child. The jury must have tremendous sympathy for Johnny, but ultimately they are expected to follow the law in making their decision.""

As for the defamation case at hand, Depp has an uphill battle.

""He has to prove actual malice to win a defamation lawsuit. That's a much more difficult hurdle to climb than when suing someone who is not a public figure. Depp must prove that Heard knew her statements were false when she made them,"" says Lewis.

Depp's career could get a lifeline, though.

""This is a lose-lose situation for both but I think Johnny comes out looking better and social media comments kind of reflect that,"" he adds. ""Also, remember Hollywood has a short memory. Remember when Robert Downey Jr.'s career was in the tank after his substance abuse, bizarre behavior and breaking into someone's home? He has fully overcome that phase of his life and Depp could do the same, especially with a win here.""

"In Polarized Texas, Rare Accord: A Hispanic Mother Shouldn't Be Executed","HOUSTON — In less than a week, Texas is set to execute Melissa Lucio, a mother of 14 who was convicted of murder in the death of her 2-year-old daughter more than a decade ago.

The execution would be the first of a Hispanic woman in Texas, and it has drawn widespread attention — from a 2020 documentary to a recent segment on “Last Week Tonight With John Oliver” — because of new evidence and expert testimony casting strong doubt about her guilt.

Lucio’s case has also done something rare in the intensely polarized political climate of Texas: It has brought Democratic and Republican lawmakers together in mutual outcry. Scores of legislators have called for clemency or at least a reprieve, including those who are ordinarily vigorous backers of the death penalty.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

“It will be a historic, irreversible blunder on the part of the state of Texas if we go forward with this,” said state Rep. Jeff Leach, a Republican from north of Dallas who has been a leading voice in Texas urging a halt to the execution. “I’ve never seen a more troubling case than the case of Melissa Lucio.”

Five of the jurors in her case have also come out in favor of clemency or a reprieve, citing in part the new evidence. “I voted to sentence Melissa Lucio to death. I was wrong,” one wrote in the Houston Chronicle.

The challenges to Lucio’s execution highlight familiar failings of the nation’s criminal justice system, including a confession given after hours of interrogation, evidence presented as scientific that has since been questioned, an inadequate defense and gender bias.

“Police targeted Melissa because she didn’t fit their image of how a grieving mother should behave” in the aftermath of her daughter’s death, said Sandra Babcock, one of Lucio’s lawyers and the director of the Cornell Center on the Death Penalty Worldwide.

Lucio’s daughter Mariah died at home. Her lawyers have said that Mariah went down for a nap and did not wake up and that, two days earlier, she had fallen down a flight of stairs. An autopsy said the cause of death was blunt force trauma to the head.

The fact that Lucio, 53, is on death row at all is an outlier. It is rare for prosecutors to seek the death penalty in a case where a mother has been charged with killing her children, her lawyers said.

One issue her lawyers are raising is the legal provision — unique to Texas — under which prosecutors must prove a person’s “future dangerousness” in order to secure a death sentence. Lucio did not have a history of acting violently before Mariah’s death, so prosecutors relied heavily on disciplinary records from her time behind bars after her arrest. Lucio’s lawyers have argued that the prosecution misrepresented those records and that she had not engaged in significant misconduct.

Lucio, who lived in the border city of Harlingen, struggled to provide for her large family. At the time of Mariah’s death, she was pregnant with twins and already had 12 children.


At the time of Mariah’s death in 2007, Lucio lived with Mariah’s father, Robert Alvarez, and nine children; the family had just moved into a new apartment. The police interviewed both Alvarez and Lucio, but her lawyers said they approached Alvarez much differently, treating him more as a witness than a suspect. He was eventually convicted of a much lesser charge of causing injury to Mariah by omission — by failing to seek medical care for her — and sentenced to four years in prison.

In their interrogation immediately after Mariah’s death, the police accused Lucio of beating her daughter to death. Prosecutors pointed to bruises on Mariah’s body and an untreated broken arm as evidence of abuse.

But from the start, Lucio maintained her innocence, saying her daughter had fallen down a flight of stairs as the family was moving out of an apartment two days earlier. Her lawyers have presented expert testimony that the bruising could have been caused by her fall down the stairs, and that broken arms are not uncommon in young children prone to falls. Mariah had a medical history of falling, including at day care, and no record of prior bruises, the lawyers said.


During a hearing this month in the state Capitol, lawmakers repeatedly pressed the Cameron County district attorney, Luis V. Saenz, a Democrat, to withdraw the execution warrant — a move that would allow the defense more time to pursue a new trial. (The district attorney who prosecuted Lucio, Armando Villalobos, is serving a 13-year sentence for corruption unrelated to her case.)

Saenz declined to intervene.

“For me to sit here unilaterally and just pull the plug on it,” he told legislators, “then what do I say to the other 195 poor souls that are on death row right now, who by the way are also innocent?” His comment drew gasps and guffaws from those in the hearing room.

In their application for clemency to the Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles, lawyers for Lucio presented medical evidence explaining how the fall could have caused her death as well as the bruising on her body, saying it was not considered at trial. (Her trial defense did bring up the fall, but presented only one expert medical witness who testified about Mariah’s head injuries.) The lawyers, including those from the Innocence Project, also argued that the jury was not told of Mariah’s medical history, which included past falls.

Her lawyers have also challenged Lucio’s statements to the police in the immediate aftermath of Mariah’s death that were used against her, saying they had been obtained after five hours of coercive interrogation known to result in false confessions.

“How did you hit her?” a Texas Ranger asked.

“I never hit her head,” Lucio replied.

“How would you hit her?” the ranger asked.

“I would just spank her,” she said.

Elsewhere, investigators suggested that Lucio abused Mariah and caused her death because she was simply a frustrated and overwhelmed mother, an idea that Lucio eventually appeared to adopt during the interrogation. “I was just frustrated,” she said.

“You see Ms. Lucio regurgitate the words that the investigators provide,” said David Thompson, the president of a law enforcement training company who reviewed footage of the interrogation for Lucio’s lawyers.


“I would say that it is an unreliable, involuntary, coerced compliant confession,” Thompson said in an interview.

But even as many conservatives in the Legislature signed letters supporting Lucio, some faced pushback. Leach, in an appearance with conservative podcast host Allie Beth Stuckey, spent nearly an hour debating the case.

“I don’t think it’s right to say that she is probably innocent,” Stuckey said, citing Lucio’s history of neglect, her confession and other evidence presented during her trial.

Leach stressed that he was not insisting on Lucio’s innocence but on her need for a new trial to consider the new evidence.

“There’s a lot of people on the right who are very supportive of the death penalty and just aren’t sure that Melissa should be saved,” said state Rep. Lacey Hull, a Republican. “I hope her case makes everyone take a much greater look at the death penalty in general and where we need to make changes.”

Hull visited Lucio this month as part of a group that included Leach and Democratic and Republican members of the Legislature. They prayed together with Lucio.


"For sale in Maine: private island, inward journey - yours for $339,000","Billy Milliken warned his daughter's boyfriend that, if he wanted Milliken's blessing before proposing marriage, the couple would have to spend two days alone on his private island.

But Milliken's is not that kind of private island. Nestled off the Maine coast between Acadia National Park and the Canadian border, it has no white sand beaches, no palm trees and no cabana boy to fetch cocktails adorned with tiny umbrellas.

Subscribe to The Post Most newsletter for the most important and interesting stories from The Washington Post.

Instead, there's an outdoor shower, a shanty of an outhouse and electricity produced by a ""suitcase generator."" And seals - lots and lots of barking seals.

Then there was Milliken's personal prohibition: No cellphones.

Related video: Inside a $27.75 million apartment on Billionaire's Row in New York City

""They were going to spend some time out there on the island alone,"" he said. ""It was either going to make them or break them.""

His daughter and her boyfriend survived and, with Milliken's blessing, got married last year. He's expecting a grandchild in July.

Now, all 1 12 acres of the mettle-testing island can be yours. Milliken is selling Duck Ledges Island ""in its entirety"" for $339,000. It's a spit of land in Wohoa Bay topped with the 540-square-foot cottage that Milliken built and not much else. For 15 years, the island has served as refuge, sanctuary, vacation home, gathering place and recreation spot whenever he wanted to hop in his boat and escape his office or home in nearby Jonesport. He loves the island for the awe it inspired when he was alone and the community it helped create when he brought others with him. Over the last couple of years, however, Milliken hasn't gone there as much as he felt he should - ""an injustice to the island"" - and now wants to pass along its charms.

But not to just anyone, which is kind of how he came to own Duck Ledges Island in the first place.

Story continues

Milliken bought it in 2007 almost by accident. As a real estate agent, he was actually trying to sell the island for the previous owner. While heading there with a prospective buyer on Milliken's boat - the only way to access the island - the guy started transferring a cache of weapons from one of two duffel bags he'd brought with him to an array of pockets on his person.

Milliken peeked in the guy's second duffel bag while on the island - a sniper rifle. On the way back, the guy unloaded the weapons from his pockets to stash them back in the duffel, but not all of them. As they entered the marina, he bragged to Milliken that he could use one of his throwing stars to decapitate a duck that had come into view.

""He was just trying to be cool and liked,"" Milliken said.

The owner, afraid that throwing-star guy was buying the island to kill a bunch of wildlife, balked at selling to him, even though he offered to pay the list price.

Then he tossed out a suggestion to Milliken: Why don't you buy it?

He did - at a steal, Milliken noted, fully intending to flip the property for at least double what he paid. But then something happened that he did not expect. From 2007 to 2009, as he transformed a structure that had been moldering on the island for decades into the 540-square-foot cottage that stands today, Milliken fell in love with the island - with the solitude, the crashing waves, the barking seals, the water that stretched far away. And then there was the love it fostered when he brought people out for lobster bakes or campfire nights.

Money problems forced Milliken to sell the island after a couple of years. Like his predecessor, he rejected buyers whose intentions or attitudes he felt were unworthy of the island, like the man who made a respectable offer but complained about all the things it didn't have. The man who passed Milliken's test had spent time on a similar island as a kid and wanted give that experience to others.

""He shared the same passion for the island we did, and that was important to us,"" Milliken said.

The man rejected the traditional concept of a real estate purchase, opting instead to become ""partners in ownership"" with Milliken, who's continued maintaining the property for more than a decade.

""Through the years, we've shared the island with his friends, our friends, random people,"" Milliken said. ""We've never taken a dime for it. It's really brought a lot of good for our hearts doing that.""

In 2019, he bought the island back but continued the shared stewardship.

Milliken has since devoted his efforts to another island he owns, an 11-acre property in Maine where he hopes to build a home in which he can live year round - a project inspired by Duck Ledges. Since he no longer takes advantage of all the island has to offer, he wants to sell it to someone who can.

""I hope the future owner gets a fraction of the joy that I've had,"" he said.

But it's not for everybody, which is why, aside from paying him a few hundred thousand dollars, Milliken has another requirement for any would-be buyer: They have to stay at least one night on the island to see if they can hack it. That's held up any possible sale since no one can go to the island from the last week in October through late May, not unless you want to die by freezing or getting hurt where no one can hear you scream for help, Milliken said. ""It's not going to be a good death.""

So he's waiting until he can show people what they'd be getting into.

""Sometimes you think you're Davy Crockett, but you're really Betty Crocker,"" he said.

The rewards are worth it, Milliken said. There are few distractions for those who follow the Milliken rule and leave their cellphones on the mainland, 1 14 miles away. In today's world, there are so many ""red herrings"" that distract us, that keep us running from ourselves, he said.

""You will find yourself out there,"" he said, adding, ""There's nowhere to hide.""

Milliken tried to describe the experience for those who have never been: He's been out there in the dark, the waves crashing, seals barking and night sky stretching until it drooped and surrounded him. He was just a tiny man on a tiny island in the middle of an ocean.

""It makes you feel small,"" he said, ""in the best kind of way.""

"Trump's Oz, Vance endorsements bring cash windfall, backlash","INDEPENDENCE, Ohio (AP) — Former President Donald Trump’s late endorsements in hypercompetitive Republican Senate primaries in Ohio and Pennsylvania have unlocked a flood of support for his chosen candidates, including millions in cash.

But the endorsements have also provoked backlash from some Republicans who believe Trump has betrayed his core supporters by backing “Hillbilly Elegy” author JD Vance in Ohio and TV’s Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania. Both candidates have been criticized for time spent outside their states and being insufficiently committed to the former president and his “America First” agenda.

The blowback has included calls by a major conservative group aligned with a Vance rival to boycott the rally Trump is holding Saturday night to try to boost his candidate. The state’s tea party movement, which overwhelmingly supports Trump, is also planning a protest outside.

“For him to endorse JD Vance really seemed like President Trump was out of touch with what’s going on in Ohio and what his supporters here want,” said Tom Zawistowski, a leader of the group.

It’s unclear whether Trump’s support will pull Vance and Oz across the finish line in races that will serve as key early tests of the former president’s clout in this year’s midterm elections. But the endorsements pose a risk to Trump, who has staked his status as a GOP kingmaker on his ability to mobilize his supporters as he eyes another White House run in 2024.

In Ohio, Trump's endorsement has been a major boon to Vance, who had been trailing in the polls before Trump’s intervention. While allies concede Trump's announcement at 5 p.m. on Good Friday, less than three weeks before the May 3 primary election, may not have been the most desirable timing, the campaign nonetheless reports a 300% increase in online donations — a majority from new donors — including $20,000 raised online and $30,000 by bundlers that Friday alone.

Both groups are using that money to air new ads trumpeting Trump's endorsement that they expect to run exclusively through the rest of the campaign.

“We want to make sure 100% of people know about it. And we’re going to go all out on that,"" said Luke Thompson, who runs the super PAC, which has found that Vance's support rises when voters are made aware that he is Trump's pick.

Ohio strategists and rival campaigns had long conceded an endorsement from Trump, who remains deeply popular with Republican voters despite his 2020 election defeat and his role in inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, was likely to push any candidate to the front of the pack. Vance aides see the endorsement as particularly useful for their candidate given that the chief line of attack lodged against him has been his past criticism of Trump.

But the endorsement has also sparked deep resentment from those backing Vance's rivals, who launched a furious, last-ditch effort last week to try to change Trump’s mind. Trump has called on his supporters to rally around Vance, but Vance's chief rivals, including the Trump-aligned Club for Growth, which supports former state treasurer Josh Mandel, have so far refused to stand down. They have instead continued to run anti-Vance ads, drawing anger, in particular, from Trump's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who has been campaigning for Vance and is set to return to the state Monday for a full day of events.

Joe Kildea, a Club for Growth spokesperson, said the group will increase its spending in the coming days to air even more anti-Vance ads.



So far, some voters are siding with Trump.

Linda Davidson, a retired financial consultant from Kirtland, said Trump’s endorsement “very much” crystallized her vote for Vance.

“I was actually waiting. I couldn’t decide,” she said after an event in the Cleveland suburb of Independence on Wednesday. “I was kind of confused on who to vote for.”

But at a Mandel event near Cleveland on Thursday, Jeanine Hammack, the campaign chair for the Strongsville Republican Party, said Trump’s endorsement will “not at all” influence her vote.

“We love Trump. Always will,” she said, adding that she's sure the former president “has his reasons” for picking Vance, but that she knows Mandel better.

In Pennsylvania, Oz is seeing a similar bump since Trump's surprise April 9 endorsement in his close race against former hedge fund CEO David McCormick. The week following Trump’s endorsement was the best digital fundraising week for Oz since his campaign launched late last year, with the campaign bringing in nearly three times as much money as it had the week before, said campaign manager Casey Contres.

Some supporters concede that Oz could still lose the May 17 primary with Trump's backing, but argue he likely wouldn't have been able to win without it. His team has shifted its ad strategy for television and digital pitches to focus on the former president’s announcement.

“It is a game changer,"" said John Fredericks, a talk radio host who had urged Trump to back the celebrity doctor.

“Trump's endorsement has given people a chance to stop and think and go, ‘Wait a minute. I’ve seen this guy on TV helping people for 30 years. Trump sees it, too. And now I'm going to take a second look,'"" Fredericks said.

Oz acknowledged the impact during a virtual town hall Trump held Friday night to rally support for his candidate.

""Mr. President, there are a lot of voters who are passionate about you who have said that they’re coming out to see me because of your endorsement,"" Oz said, before asking Trump if he would “mind easing people’s fears” by vouching for Oz's conservative credentials.

Trump assured listeners that the doctor was the only candidate who has his support and the only one he believes can win the general election.

It was an acknowledgement of the fact that Trump's endorsement of a man who has little history with the Republican Party — not to mention Pennsylvania, after living in New Jersey for the past two decades — has roiled party activists who aren't sold on Oz and believe that he is insufficiently conservative on issues like guns and abortion.

While some county party officials said the endorsement had no further divided Republicans than they had been already, given the seven-candidate primary field, some county party officials reported a tide of angry calls.

"After collapse, this chain had one Boise restaurant left — make that Idaho. It closed","The lone Idaho location of a chain known for toasted submarine sandwiches is now toast itself.

Quiznos recently closed at 2250 E. Gowen Road in Boise.

The locally owned franchise restaurant at Columbia Village was the last of a disappearing brand that once was ubiquitous not just in the Gem State, but across America.

Quiznos sandwiches still have plenty of enthusiasts. Whether it’s the Spicy Monterey or the limited-time Old Bay Lobster Club, the menu gets the juices flowing. Even the Traditional “has it all,” as Quiznos brags on its website, “with Black Angus steak, oven-roasted turkey breast, smoked ham, melted cheddar, fresh lettuce, and tomatoes with creamy ranch dressing, served toasted.”

Founded in 1981, Denver-based Quiznos grew into one of the nation’s largest sub slingers by the early 21st century. But a multitude of problems — including stiff competition ranging from Subway to Jimmy John’s — caused an epic downfall during the past 15 years or so. Trade publication Restaurant Business called it “one of the biggest restaurant chain collapses in industry history.”

At its peak in 2006, Quiznos had nearly 5,000 locations, Restaurant Business reported. As of May 2021, the publication wrote, that number had dropped to 255.

As recently as 2015, there were four Quiznos franchises in the Boise area. Boiseans might remember one closing that year at 1216 N. Orchard St., leaving two in the city, at 8665 W. Franklin Road and 2250 E. Gowen Road, as well as an Eagle store at 664 S. Rivershore Lane. Before that, there was a Quiznos on Overland Road in Boise, in Meridian, even in Kuna.

Fat Guys Fresh Deli, a Meridian-based business, plans to take over the former Quiznos space at 2250 E.

6 fascinating facts about vaginas that every woman should know,"In honor of National Vagina Appreciation Day on April 23, ob-gyns are breaking down a few fascinating facts about vaginas. (Photo: Getty Images)

The vagina is an important part of the female anatomy, but many people know very little about it.

""When we do exams in the office, we get out a mirror, show women their vaginas and point out the anatomy of the area,"" Dr. Lauren Streicher, a clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine and creator of the podcast Dr. Streicher's Inside Information, tells Yahoo Life. ""For the majority of women, this is the first time they take a close look.""

Many people, Streicher adds, ""don't know the correct terminology and anatomy"" for describing the area. Dr. Christine Greves, an ob-gyn at the Winnie Palmer Hospital for Women and Babies in Orlando, agrees. ""A lot of women don't know a whole lot about their vaginas,"" she tells Yahoo Life.

As Dr. Jennifer Wider, a women's health expert, tells Yahoo Life, ""Whether the fault lies in sex education in the schools, public health messaging, self-reluctance or a combination, not knowing and understanding how the entire body functions and what is normal or abnormal could have health consequences.

""It’s vital to understand our bodies,"" she says, ""even the parts we can’t see all that well.""

With that in mind — and in honor of National Vagina Appreciation Day on April 23 — we checked in with some ob-gyns and came back with a few fascinating facts about vaginas.

Fact No. 1: The vagina is self-cleaning

The vagina is sometimes compared to a ""self-cleaning oven,"" as Greves puts it. The bacteria in the vagina include good bacteria called lactobacillus, she says, adding that they work something like a robot vacuum. ""It just takes care of your vagina,"" Greves says. ""If you have the appropriate amount of lactobacillus, it's able to combat the bad bacteria and yeast that could overgrow otherwise.""

The vagina also sheds its outermost cells to clean itself, flushing them out in discharges and mucus, Wider says.

Fact No. 2: You can't actually 'lose' anything in your vagina

Horror stories float around online about women ""losing"" tampons in their vagina, but although foreign objects can get stuck in the vagina, losing them isn't possible, Streicher says. ""Everybody thinks the vagina is this open-ended road, but the truth is that it's a dead end,"" she says. ""You can't lose a tampon or anything in there, because it stops at the dead end.""

For most women, she says, that's the cervix, the lower part of the uterus, which typically only opens during childbirth. In a hysterectomy, the back of the vagina is sewn closed, ""So it's still a dead end,"" Streicher explains.

Fact No. 3: Vagina and vulva are not the same thing

Ob-gyns say they often hear their patients confusing the two. ""I still have women come into the office and say that their vagina hurts when they mean their vulva,"" Greves says. ""People just use one term for the entire area.""

Streicher agrees. ""No one uses the term 'vulva,'"" she says. ""But the vagina is completely internal. Anything you see is the vulva."" Streicher says the reason for this is probably cultural. ""Little girls aren't taught the proper terminology, and no one uses it,"" she says.

Fact No. 4: The depth of the vagina increases during arousal

Most women aren't aware of this, Streicher says, but ""During arousal, there is increased blood flow to the genitalia,"" she explains. ""It also lengthens in order to accommodate a penis — biologically, that's why we have sex."" In general, ""the aroused vagina is longer and a little more dilated than a non-aroused vagina,"" she adds.

Fact No. 5: Your vagina isn't supposed to be odor-free

Despite the frequent use of douches and other feminine deodorizing products, Streicher points out that it's ""normal for a vagina to have a scent."" (The use of douches and deodorant sprays are not recommended by ob-gyns, since they can lead to vaginal infections.)

""It's normal for the vagina to have a light scent,"" Streicher says. However, a strong, foul odor or fishy smell could be the sign of an infection — such as bacterial vaginosis, the most common vaginal infection in women — and should prompt a trip to the doctor, she says.

Fact No. 6: Vaginas and vulvas come in all shapes and sizes

Just like other body parts, every vulva and vagina looks slightly different. ""Many women feel self-conscious about the appearance of their vulva, but they shouldn’t,"" Wider says. ""Vulvae come in all different shapes and sizes. There is a wide range of normal.""

Greves agrees, noting that the labia (the folds of skin around the vaginal opening) can be longer in some women and asymmetrical. ""Every one is different,"" she adds.

Former Oak Park High standout runner Sarah Shulze dies at age 21,"Sarah Shulze was a standout distance runner at Oak Park High who earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin.

Sarah Shulze was energetic, ambitious, committed.

She served her hometown of Oak Park as a member of the National Charity League and was a dedicated member of the Associated Student Body at Oak Park High for four years. She was the senior class secretary in 2019 and helped plan the senior prom.

In her time at the University of Wisconsin, she earned an internship to the Wisconsin state Legislature and volunteered as a poll worker for the 2020 presidential election.

Shulze was worldly, with her thirst for adventure taking her on trips to Europe, Africa and Alaska.

She was a stellar athlete, too. Shultz's powerhouse senior season in cross country for Oak Park High included a Coastal Canyon League title, a CIF-Southern Section Division 3 championship and a runner-up finish in the CIF-State Division III finals.

At season's end, Shulze was named The Star's Runner of the Year for 2018. She, in turn, earned a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin.

Now that bright light has been extinguished, at least in life. Her family has announced that the 21-year-old Shulze died on April 13 in Wisconsin. They revealed, in a website posting, that their daughter ""took her own life.""

""Balancing athletics, academics and the demands of every day life overwhelmed her in a single, desperate moment,"" the posting said.

She is survived by her parents, Brigitte and Scott, and sisters Abbey and Ella.

""She was surrounded by her loving family,"" the tribute website said.

It is the family's hope that their daughter's suicide helps awaken others to the fragility of mental health.

Shulze will be honored in Ventura County in a Celebration of Life ceremony set for May 2 at 3 p.m. at Calvary Community Church in Westlake Village. The address is 5495 Via Rocas. The family said all are welcome.

A similar ceremony will be held Sunday at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

Sarah Shulze won the 1,600-meter title in Division 3 at the CIF-SS Track and Field Championships in 2018.

Shulze is remembered affectionately by those who knew her at Oak Park High.

Story continues

""The world is a better place for Sarah having been part of it,"" said athletic director Tim Chevalier. ""While her passing has been difficult to process, I take hope that her stories will continue to be told and her positive impact on others will be remembered.""

Chevalier said Shulze excelled in sports and in life.

""In the classroom, Sarah was a top-notch student,"" he said. ""On the track, Sarah was a fierce competitor who absolutely electric and continually pushed herself to be great.

""Off the track, Sarah was a gentle and kind soul, a loving daughter, sister, friend and human who will be dearly missed by those who knew her and loved her.""

Dr. Jeff Davis was appointed superintendent of the Oak Park Unified School District after Shulze's high school graduation, but noted her impact on the school and community.

""I sadly never had the honor to know Sarah,"" he said. ""However, I can tell you that Sarah left a lasting and indelible imprint on the Oak Park Unified School District, Oak Park High School and the community of Oak Park that will never, ever go away.

""Sarah was a top student, a tremendous athlete and teammate, a wonderful friend, and a loving daughter and sister. She will be missed by so many, yet never forgotten by those that were fortunate to know her.""

The University of Wisconsin said its community is ""heartbroken.""

""Sarah was a beloved daughter, sister, granddaughter, friend, teammate and Badger student-athlete,"" the statement read. ""We extend our deepest sympathies and sincere condolences to Sarah's family, friends and Badger teammates during this extraordinarily difficult time. Our primary focus is the support of the Shulze family and our student-athletes.""

Among Shulze's athletic exploits as an Oak Park senior was winning five of eight cross country races in which she competed, including the CIF-SS Division 3 title with a time of 17 minutes, 15.9 seconds.

Among her proudest achievements was winning the Ventura County Championship at Lake Casitas with a time of 17:30.3, then the No. 6 all-time mark in the race.


As a junior for the Badgers, Shulze recently finished first in the 3,000 meters and notched a personal best in the mile at the Larry Wieczorkek Invitational.

Her high school coach, Steve White, noted in The Star's story honoring her cross country achievements as a senior that Shulze relied on more than physical ability.

""She has that unique gift to go out there and punish herself,"" said White. ""Knowing what it's going to take to meet the goals she would set. It goes to her mental toughness.""

Sarah Shulze won the Coastal Canyon League title, the CIF-SS Division 3 title and took second in the Division III state meet in her final cross country season at Oak Park.

Her family, in the website posting, said Shulze was instilled with deep compassion for others.

""Above all other things, Sarah was a power for good in the world,"" they wrote. ""Her deep compassion was evident in her devotion to her sisters Abbey and Ella, the love her parents felt from her every single day and the extra care she took in moments shared with her grandparents and cousins.""

Shulze's death is the second tragedy involving a former Ventura County standout athlete in the past two months.

Katie Meyer, a former Newbury Park High soccer standout and Stanford University star, took her own life on March 1 at her residence on the Palo Alto campus.

This Often-overlooked Button in Your Car Can Make Your Ride More Comfortable — and Help You Save on Gas,"Summer is just around the corner, which means scorching temperatures will soon be upon us. While that's a welcome fact for a day at the beach, it's not so fun when you have to get into a sweltering car for a long commute. There is, however, one thing that can help cool down that rather uncomfortable summer experience in a snap. And it all comes down to a single, often-overlooked button on your car's dashboard: the recirculation button.

When you get in your car later for a drive, make sure to check out the dash to find the recirculation button. It's usually the little button with an icon of a car and a sideways-u-shaped arrow inside of it. Here's a little more about what it does and how to use it effectively.

What Is the Air Recirculation Button?

Car company Eden Tyers & Servicing shared in a blog post, ""The air recirculation button effectively cuts off the outside air to the inside of the car 'recirculating' air inside your vehicle."" This makes it easier to ensure you're recirculating air-conditioned air rather than hot air from outside.

What Does the Air Recirculation Button Do?

The post goes on to explain that the air recirculation button is great for, ""boosting your AC to help your cabin get as cold as possible as quickly as possible, stopping pollution and exhaust fumes"" and even ""reducing pollen when driving if you suffer from hay fever"" and ""stopping strong outdoor odors entering your car.""

The button works by helping your car recirculate the cool air from your AC from the moment you turn it on. If you choose not to use the button, your car will have to pull in air from the outside and work twice as hard to cool that air than the already chilled air around you.

When's the Right Time to Use the Air Recirculation Button?

Because the air recirculation button is great when you're using your car's air conditioning, you'll likely want to use it when you're driving in a heat wave. This will ensure your air conditioning gets as cold as possible as quickly as possible.

Story continues

""If you don't switch the air-recirculation button on, then your air-con will be constantly cooling warm air from outside your vehicle and will have to work much harder, putting more stress on the blower & air compressor,"" the blog post explained.

What Are the Benefits of an Air Recirculation Button?

If you're reading this in 2022, or likely any time in the near future, you know that gas prices have gone bananas. That's why it's an excellent idea to set a reminder to use your air recirculation, because the harder your AC has to work, the more fuel your car will consume. The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Cars typically are more fuel-efficient when the air conditioner is set to recirculate interior air. This is because keeping the same air cool takes less energy than continuously cooling hot air from outside."" The Journal did, of course, also point out that ""turning off the air conditioner saves even more fuel.""

Furthermore, using the air recirculation button means you'll be putting less stress on your AC, helping the system to last just a bit longer.

When Should You Avoid Using the Air Recirculation Button?

While the recirculation button is great for the summer months, it may be best to avoid it in the winter. That's because the button (by design) traps moisture inside your car, and in the winter that could add up to foggy windows and a foggy windshield.

The Eden Tyers & Servicing blog post also warned, ""Some drivers think it makes sense to not have 'all that cold air coming in' if they are using heaters in winter. However, in reality, it's best to keep it switched off. The standard 'fresh air' mode forces the outside air through your heater core so it's nice and toasty before it reaches you, and your windows will de-fog a lot quicker and stay that way while you drive.""",Stacey Leasca,https://yahoo.com/lifestyle/often-overlooked-button-car-ride-202349395.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8_CWuHRyziuOi7oDHIvyDw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aaHyi38.XFcpm7YA4horiQ--~B/aD0xMjAwO3c9MTgwMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/travel.travelleisure.com/b59139dfa56c39ba3ef101864badb59b,Yahoo
Woman accidentally spends over $500 at seafood restaurant: 'I didn't even realize',"In The Know by Yahoo

A woman couldn’t believe she racked up over $500 in seafood at a local restaurant.

Biden's executive order on cryptocurrency – here's what it means for you

TikToker Damienne Flagler visited The Boiler in Atlanta and treated herself to a veritable feast. When she got the bill, she was stunned by how expensive some of the menu items were. She lamented in the comments section of the post, “I swear we could’ve got a house full of groceries,” and that she even asked if she could do dishes to pay off the debt.

Watch this living room that hasn't been updated since the '60s get a modern redesign:

First, she had the blue rock candy martini ($14). Then, Flagler ordered the fried crab cakes ($18), fried cheese sticks ($8), sweet potato fries ($7) and seafood eggrolls ($16) as appetizers. To “boost her appetite” for the next round of food, she had another blue rock candy martini.

For the main course, she had a boil bag ($64.99) full of lobster tails ($22), snow crabs ($39.99), crawfish, shrimp, beef sausage (extra $6), black mussels, corn, egg, potato and ramen noodles (extra $10). But she wasn’t done yet: She had the fried king crab, which came with six pieces.

Flagler loved everything she ate and wasn’t disappointed, but she admitted she may have gotten a little carried away with her order.

“Y’all got to try this place. But I got to keep it 100% with y’all. This is not a cheap date. My big a** ordering all of this food, and I didn’t even realize the king crab alone [was] $200! What!?” Flagler said in the video, showing off the itemized receipt.

After a 3% processing fee, taxes and 18% tip, the total price for the seafood feast cost $527.37.

“Your belly gone be full but your pockets gone be empty,” she wrote in the caption.

The cautionary tale racked up over 1.7 million views on TikTok.

“$200! Nah, baby. I’m cooking this at home,” a user wrote.

“I would’ve gone to the bathroom and jumped out the window,” another joked.

This viral video of a little girl stopping a Black model to admire her dress will warm your heart,"Monica Ahanonu might be a model, but she’s not always comfortable with people staring at her.

It’s why, after getting all gussied up for a big event, dressed in a white designer gown, makeup done, and heels strapped on, she still felt the flutter of nerves.

“I don’t like people watching me,” she explained in an interview with TODAY. “I like dressing up and wearing crazy things, but I don’t like people to watch me at the same time.”

Still, at a friend’s insistence, Ahanonu stood for a few photos on the street to capture her look. While her friend snapped pictures, Ahanonu realized a father and his toddler were nearby, looking on and waiting to pass. “I felt bad they were waiting. So I told him to go, and the dad said that his daughter might take a while to cross the street,” Ahanonu explained, adding that she didn’t mind waiting. After all, since she’s not great with having people gawk at her, she was feeling timid.

That’s the funny thing about children, Ahanonu, 31, noted. They don’t pick up on the insecurities adults accumulate over their lifetimes.


The video struck a chord online and as of Friday, had nearly 4.7 million likes.

For commenters on the video, one of the most touching moments is when the little girl turned around and revealed that the doll in her stroller is Black as well.

“Girl!!!! The levels to this,” one user replied to the post, which is peppered with hundreds of heart-eyed emojis in the comments.

“Baby’s know an angel when they see one,” another wrote.

It was a touching moment, especially considering the long-held preferences for dolls in the past and the race-based prejudices that have been a factor.

Story continues

In the 1940s, Dr. Kenneth Clark and his wife, Mamie Clark ( both psychologists ), conducted a series of experiments known as “the doll tests.” The experience was an effort to examine the psychological effects segregation had on Black children between the ages of three to seven. The children were asked to identify the race of the dolls, assign “good” and “bad” traits to each, and share which doll they preferred.


In 2010, CNN commissioned another study that sought to determine if these racial biases had changed. Surveying 133 children, they found that nearly seven decades after the original test, white and Black children still preferred the white doll.

Ahanonu — a Black woman with a mother who immigrated from Uganda and a father who came from Biafra — remembers what it was like to have race come up in her early days on the playground.

""Me and my siblings were the only Black kids in our elementary school, middle school, and high school,"" she explained. ""(We) had Black dolls, but I don't think any of my friends really did.""

It’s possible that the little girl in the video has yet to experience how aspects of race affect women of color like Ahanonu on a nearly day-to-day basis. She was also likely unaware that their brief interaction would be enough to make Ahanonu feel encouraged.

“It was more (of) a confirmation like, ‘Okay, I do look good, I guess,’” she told TODAY, noting that it wouldn’t have felt quite as genuine from an adult.

Ahanonu said the interaction makes her feel hopeful for the future.

“It’s a good sign that hopefully, things will be less divided as we go forward,” she said. “These generations coming up, (they) seem to be way less divided than the generation before us… It’s subconscious stuff that we don’t even realize and didn’t realize for a long time, obviously, even when we were younger so it’s cool to see that, and I’m curious, hopeful that (younger generations’) subconscious will be different than what ours or what our parents were.”

In the meantime, Ahanonu’s holding out hope she will be able to learn more about the little girl sometime soon.

""I wish I could talk to her dad so much,” Ahanonu said. “I want to ask him about her and (see) what they thought about it.”",Alex Portée,https://yahoo.com/news/viral-video-little-girl-stopping-012004313.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/547JtZ_CvPlIvl6UwD.c4A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/WRM7sX9Sd1c.5dpACyFc2g--~B/aD0xMDgwO3c9MTkyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/nbc_today_217/72411538815935ad53d1b74739c00143,Yahoo
"A superyacht captain says wealthy Russians he's worked for made employees take lie detector tests to prove they've kept information confidential, a report says","A superyacht at sea. Heesen Yachts

A superyacht captain who worked for wealthy Russians has described his experiences.

He told The Guardian employees had to take lie detector tests to uphold requirements about secrecy.

He even revealed contracts that ban staff from taking photographs or drawings of the yachts.

A superyacht captain who's spent 15 years at sea detailed his experience working for wealthy Russians.

The Guardian reported the account of the captain, who remains anonymous.

Per the outlet, the captain who has sailed ultra-rich individuals throughout the Caribbean and Mediterranean said superyacht owners are extremely secretive about their ships and what happens onboard.

One contract revealed to The Guardian showed that employees had to take a lie detector test to prove they were upholding the levels of secrecy required by their bosses.

Superyacht owners also required their employees to sign a non-disclosure agreement to even secure an interview for a job onboard, the captain told the outlet.

""They're operated in a super-secretive way so they can use them and deflect attention from the ownership,"" the captain said.

He added that superyacht employees must also sign contracts agreeing not to share business documents, photographs, and even drawings of the superyachts.

His experience chimes with that of another superyacht worker, who was recently interviewed. The designer told The FT that his job required lots of secrecy and he was unable to take any photos of his handiwork.

Superyachts and their owners have been scrutinized since Russia invaded Ukraine earlier this year. The war prompted a string of Western-imposed sanctions on Russia in retaliation for their actions. Many measures have targeted wealthy Russians and their luxury assets.

With so many Russian oligarchs' yachts being impounded, some owners are sailing their ships around the seas to avoid them being seized, or turning their ship's tracking signal off to avoid detection.

According to recent ship-tracking data, an $80 million superyacht linked to sanctioned Russian oligarch Vagit Alekperov has spent seven weeks lingering off the coast of Montenegro to avoid being seized, as Insider's Kate Duffy reported.

Early look at first round of 2022 fantasy football drafts,"Reuters

Hong Kong will allow non residents to enter the financial hub from May for the first time in more than two years, a small step in unwinding stringent coronavirus restrictions which have turned the city into one of the world's most isolated places. Hong Kong's rules for airlines that carry infected COVID-19 patients will also be eased slightly, the government said in a statement on Friday, with the threshold for suspending incoming flights rising to five infected passengers from three currently.

2022 NFL mock draft: Eagles make most stunning pick(s) in post-free agency edition,"After one of the wildest free-agency periods in recent memory, and perhaps ever, the NFL’s offseason activity has reduced to a bit of a simmer.

But fear not: With the 2022 NFL draft less than a month away, we’re now in full swing with the second big phase of the offseason, and we expect more surprises to come.

Mock drafts theoretically can be taken a bit more seriously now. Prospect workouts are nearly complete. Team needs are far more clear, and their actions (and inaction) to this point offer us more clues which directions they might head in April.

Yet there is still quite a bit of fog that needs to clear. As one team official told us last week, “Good luck with your mock drafts. No one knows much, especially up top.”

Gee, thanks ...

A lot of the lack of clarity centers around the quarterbacks — namely, which ones will go off the board and how early in Round 1. A few teams we've spoken with recently weren't convinced that multiple QBs are destined to land in the top 10, as we've seen in some recent media projections.

That makes this mock highly speculative, even more so than normal. It’s only fitting for this thrill-a-minute offseason we've had.

Here are the first-round projections, as well as the top selections for teams without a first-rounder:

Here's how the top 10 picks of our latest 2022 NFL mock draft. (Erick Parra Monroy/Yahoo Sports)

Michigan EDGE Aidan Hutchinson


Georgia EDGE Travon Walker


Story continues

North Carolina State OT Ikem Ekwonu

The Texans might come down to picking between Ekwonu and Alabama's Evan Neal here, and we truly don't know which way GM Nick Caserio might lean. In the end, we sided with Ekwonu for his run-blocking dominance and his big upside, whereas Neal might be closer to a finished product with a slightly lower ceiling.

Cincinnati CB Ahmad ""Sauce"" Gardner

There was a strong temptation to mock the Jets yet another Round 1 offensive lineman (Evan Neal), which would make it three years in a row. But GM Joe Douglas hasn't selected a defensive player higher than 68th in his first two drafts, and head coach Robert Saleh would love a long corner such as Gardner to flavor his defense.

Alabama OT Evan Neal

This really would be an ideal four-pick development for the Giants and first-year GM Joe Schoen. They could get some trade calls here from QB-needy teams, and the Giants would listen. But pairing Neal with the emerging Andrew Thomas could give them bookend tackles for years to come. Neal also can play guard.

Liberty QB Malik Willis


Which way will they go here, with Matt Rhule potentially fighting for his job? Absolutely a fascinating proposition — and one we're still grappling with.

Notre Dame S Kyle Hamilton

The dream would be to draft Gardner here (or at five), but with him off the board, Hamilton would be a nice ""consolation prize"" for Don Martindale's defense. Would there be reluctance to draft Hamilton based on his slow 40 times (some had him in the low 4.7s) at his pro day? We certainly hope not, and it will be an interesting litmus test for Schoen in his first year making the final call. Is he a stopwatch guy? We don't believe so.

Oregon EDGE Kayvon Thibodeaux

We know they made a serious bid for Deshaun Watson. But we just can't pull the trigger here on Pickett. This team has needs all over the place. That's why picking Thibodeaux makes sense from a talent standpoint. Plus, Atlanta had 18 sacks last year, which was dead last in the NFL — by a country mile.

Northern Iowa OT Trevor Penning

It would be very on the nose for the Seahawks to draft an FCS player here, but we wouldn't pan this pick. Penning fits the Seahawks' mentality — especially if they veer to even more bully ball this season without Russell Wilson — and it's been years since they drafted a true tackle higher than Day 3 of the draft.

Why Penning over Mississippi State's Charles Cross? Run blocking and nastiness. Pete Carroll is still the coach, after all.

10. Jets (from Seahawks)

USC WR Drake London

The Jets want more WR help, having made a strong bid to acquire Tyreek Hill but failed to do so. London is nothing like Hill, although no one is in this draft class, for that matter. But he'd give Zach Wilson a long, reliable weapon on the outside, opposite Corey Davis, with Elijah Moore and Braxton Berrios inside.

Ohio State's Garrett Wilson is another strong option, but he's not a true deep threat and is less physically imposing.

Ohio State WR Garrett Wilson


But if they stay here, the Commanders could use more playmakers if Carson Wentz is going to have any chance to succeed. A WR top three of Terry McLaurin, Dyami Brown and Wilson would offer some big-play splash.

LSU CB Derek Stingley Jr.

Which direction new GM Kwesi Adofo-Mensah heads with his first draft selection is anyone's guess. But he was part of a Cleveland front office that took a similar level of injury risk a year ago when the Browns picked Northwestern CB Greg Newsome, which proved to be savvy. Stingley also requires some character examination, so the pick would have to be made with some conviction. But corner is a need for a team that lacks talent at the position.

13. Texans (from Cleveland Browns)

Florida State EDGE Jermaine Johnson II


Mississippi State OT Charles Cross


Pitt QB Kenny Pickett

Boring is for losers. You've seen Pickett mocked to the same 2-3 teams over and over. But the Eagles quietly have done a lot of work on him, and while we would not say the odds are wildly high on this happening, neither are they remote.

Why the heck not? The team has made inquiries to trade for better quarterbacks in the past year, so it wouldn't be stunning to see a big name added to push Jalen Hurts.

16. Eagles (from Indianapolis Colts)

Georgia NT Jordan Davis


It's just a thought, anyway, and we don't believe Davis would last too much longer than this anyway.

Alabama WR Jameson Williams

Seeing Davis go off the pick prior would be a heartbreaker. They'd have to be trade-down candidates, but who is coming up here in this scenario? Nakobe Dean might make sense on some level, but we are not feeling another Round 1 linebacker after the miss (so far) on Kenneth Murray.

But they do need a receiver, as well as more speed, so Williams could be an inspired choice come November and on. With Tyreek Hill out of the division, Williams could be the new AFC West deep threat to dread once his ACL injury is healed.

Ohio State WR Chris Olave


19. Eagles

Arkansas WR Treylon Burks

Realistically, the preference would be to trade into next year with this pick. But in drafting a QB, the Eagles might be derailing that plan. And no, we're still not going to mock them a linebacker. Burks would give them a different type of receiver and another weapon for ... whoever the QB is.

We personally wouldn't take Burks this high, as much as we like him, but we could see some team maximizing his skill set.

Georgia DT Devonte Wyatt

Their eyes might be set on either Willis or Pickett. But in this scenario, the Steelers are able to address a sneaky-big need. Expecting much from Stephon Tuitt or Tyson Alualu feels a smidge risky, and Wyatt has a similar profile to previous higher-round Steelers DTs such as Ziggy Hood and Javon Hargrave.

Boston College OL Zion Johnson

Malcolm Butler's signing doesn't erase the need at corner, but we also don't think they have to go CB here. Instead, don't forget about the pretty big hole at guard with the losses of Ted Karras and Shaq Mason. Johnson is exactly what the Patriots seek in their offensive linemen: smart, tough, versatile, athletic. Height, as Mason proved, is overrated on the interior. Johnson is a stud and a Day 1 starter.

Purdue EDGE George Karlaftis

With receiver somewhat picked over and a quality pass-rush talent on the board, this is the way we'll go here. The team drafted Rashan Gary at 12 with the two Smiths signed to big money. We think they'd absolutely consider Karlaftis here as a third rusher behind Gary and Preston Smith.

Two ""Greek Freaks"" in the state of Wisconsin? We'd love it.

Washington CB Trent McDuffie

They don't seem to mind undersized DBs, and if this pick works out as well as the last Huskies DB they took (Budda Baker), it would be a two-run homer. McDuffie fills a big need and can match Baker's on-field intensity. They just need as many quality dart throws as possible at this position.

Georgia LB Nakobe Dean would be an ideal fit for the Dallas Cowboys, if he makes it to them. (AP Photo/Chris Carlson, File)

Georgia LB Nakobe Dean

To us this would just be theft. We gave Dallas a grade of ""A"" for the Micah Parsons pick, shocked he was still on the board, and we'd issue the same grade if Dean fell here. He's absolutely the perfect addition to this Dan Quinn-led defense and can do for it what Deion Jones did early in his career for Quinn's defenses in Atlanta.

Clemson CB Andrew Booth

Some smart, well-connected people we trust in media have floated Breece Hall's name here, and it's not the silliest proposition we've heard. But with a moldable No. 2 corner on the board — especially with Tyreek Hill entering the division — it would be hard to pass up Booth. He's still developing, but his upside is very good for this range.

Texas A&M OL Kenyon Green

The Titans have needs at guard and tackle, so why not get a player who has played both spots? Green is a de-cleater who can bring some big power to the party, which just feels like a good fit for a Mike Vrabel team. We like Green best inside, but he's perfectly solid at tackle.

A wide receiver makes sense, too, but Green is good value here.

Connecticut DT Travis Jones

We could see Jones fitting up front for a defensive line that's a bit shorthanded right now with Ndamukong Suh unsigned. Jones wouldn't replace Suh's pass-rush impact right away, but he would give them a physical tormentor to help disrupt up front.

28. Packers

North Dakota State WR Christian Watson

We don't personally see a first-round talent in Watson, but perhaps the Packers do, and Watson is very much their type. He's long, able to win vertically and gets after it as a run blocker. He'd likely be the Packers' third or fourth wideout but could play a pretty significant role as the shot-play target Aaron Rodgers could use.

Michigan DB Dax Hill

A steal here. Hill is a versatile nickel/safety hybrid who could allow the Chiefs to let Tyrann Mathieu walk. We even think Hill could be tried outside if needed, and the Chiefs have some recent experience with this type of conversion (L'Jarius Snead). Hill might be one of the best 20 or so prospects in this class from our perspective.

30. Chiefs

Penn State WR Jahan Dotson

He's not a Tyreek Hill replacement because no one can replace Hill. But giving Mahomes a vertical threat from the slot really could keep the Chiefs' downfield passing game aloft. He's a more polished player now than Watson, who went two picks earlier.

Iowa C Tyler Linderbaum

Zac Taylor has said Ted Karras will play center, but we could see the Bengals simply taking the best center and shifting Karras to guard based on the unforeseen circumstances unfolding here. A cornerback also could be a possibility.

32. Lions (from Los Angeles Rams)

Utah LB Devin Lloyd

In the back of our mind, we were thinking about a QB such as Desmond Ridder here. But with Lloyd sliding to this spot, it just feels like a value opportunity. Plus, the Lions pick second in Round 2, two picks away, and can still get a passer or receiver there. Lloyd could immediate vie for one of the starting LB roles.

Teams without first-rounders

39. Bears

Georgia WR George Pickens

With one of the worst WR rooms in the NFL currently, the Bears badly need some playmaking and length here, and Pickens can provide both. Justin Fields and Pickens just missed each other at Georgia, but they could be a terrific pairing in time. Pickens is a likely top-40 selection now following some good workouts.

42. Colts

Penn State EDGE Arnold Ebiketie

This absolutely feels like a player the Colts would pounce on — if he's even on the board this long. Ebiketie's draft stock has been rising, and he could crack the top 40. But if he falls, his high-energy style is a perfect fit for a defense that could use more pass-rush juice.

44. Browns

Oklahoma DT Perrion Winfrey

The Browns want more help up front, and Winfrey is the type of traits-y, explosive penetrator with upside they could seek here. He played far better at the Senior Bowl than he did on a snap-to-snap basis last season, so they could be convinced he'd thrive playing alongside Myles Garrett.

61. 49ers

Georgia OL Jamaree Salyer

With some jobs open up front, Salyer could slide in and start as a rookie if he can make the transition to guard. He's a better athlete than his workout numbers might suggest, and he could be a multi-year starter inside.

64. Broncos

Colorado State TE Trey McBride

The Vikings drafted six tight ends in a seven-year span when Broncos GM George Paton was in Minnesota's front office. The Broncos traded away Noah Fant, and though they might still see upside in Albert Okwuegbunam, giving Russell Wilson a reliable target at H-back such as McBride makes some sene. He's a similar mold to Vikings TE Irv Smith Jr., but a tick faster.

89. Raiders

UCLA OL Sean Rhyan

There's a need for reinforcements up front, and Rhyan — who has guard and tackle potential — fits the mold of blocker the Raiders sought for years. At this stage, he'd be a really nice value for the Raiders.

102. Dolphins

Wake Forest OL Zach Tom

Tom is an unusual prospect in that he has extensive experience at center (his first two seasons) and left tackle (his last two). Miami can use depth at both spots. They've tried this type of versatile OL prospect in their effort to carpet bomb the position and find the best starting five. Center might be Tom's best spot.

104. Rams

Central Michigan OL Luke Goedeke

2022 NBA Mock Draft 6.0: Best team fits for top prospects,"With Kansas' national title run capped by a 72-69 win over North Carolina, the Jayhawks' Christian Braun and Ochai Agbaji helped their 2022 NBA draft stock the most after a strong showing in the men's NCAA tournament.

Ohio State point guard Malaki Branham is rising up draft boards and even got a shoutout from LeBron James after declaring for the draft last week.

The NBA draft is three months away and a lot of who goes No. 1 will depend on team need. It has been the same three players of Chet Holmgren, Jabari Smith and Paolo Banchero at the top, and Yahoo Sports takes a look at the best fits for each of the top three players.

(Draft order is from Tankathon as of April 4.)

Ht./Wt.: 7-0, 196 pounds | Class: Freshman | Gonzaga: 14.1 ppg, 9.9 rpg, 3.7 bpg


Although Holmgren's tournament performance drew mixed reviews around the league — 19 points, 17 rebounds and seven blocks against Georgia State, and nine points and nine rebounds before fouling out against Memphis — his versatility is undeniable and will be hard to pass up for the No. 1 spot.

“His intangibles are off the chart,” one NBA scout told Yahoo Sports. “He’s so unique physically with all the other skills and abilities, and if you’re willing to take that home run swing, he’s totally worth it.”

Next-best landing spot: Oklahoma City Thunder

Imagine Holmgren in the frontcourt with 7-foot, 190-pound Aleksej Pokuševski.

Ht./Wt.: 6-10, 220 pounds | Class: Freshman | Auburn: 16.9 ppg, 7.4 rpg

Despite his 3-for-16 performance in a loss to Miami, Smith has the most upside of any player in this draft class, and his game translates well to the next level. He has great spacing on the court and is very versatile on offense, leading the SEC in 3-point shooting percentage at 42%.

Story continues

The Rockets are in rebuild mode and will be targeting a forward or center at the top of the draft, after drafting guards Jalen Green and Josh Christopher last year. Houston loves to run in transition, and Smith has the athleticism to beat players to the block or step in threes in the open court. The Rockets are shooting only 35% from 3-point range, ranking 20th overall in the NBA.

Next-best landing spot: Detroit Pistons

"2022 Frozen Four: How to watch, TV info, matchups","2022 Frozen Four: How to watch, TV info, matchups originally appeared on NBC Sports Philadelphia

Four of the top college hockey teams in the nation are shipping up to Boston with a championship on the line.

After two rounds of regional play, the Frozen Four is all that’s left of this year’s NCAA Men’s Ice Hockey Tournament. Three top seeds took care of business in the regionals to advance, while another program is still alive after pulling off an upset.

Michigan, which has the most national titles in Division I history with nine, earned the top overall seed in this year’s tournament and won the Midwest Regional. Next up for the Wolverines is Denver, which won the West Regional and is chasing its ninth championship.

The other half of the bracket features a North Star State showdown. Minnesota put together two impressive wins in the Northeast Regional, knocking out defending champion UMass and the regional’s top seed, Western Michigan. The five-time national champs’ next tilt will be against Minnesota State, which reached its second straight Frozen Four by winning the East Regional as the top seed.

With two of the country’s most storied programs and two intrastate rivals facing off, fans are in for two highly anticipated matchups. Here’s how you can check out the Frozen Four, along with the national championship game:

Where is the 2022 Men’s Frozen Four?

The 2022 Final Four will be played at TD Garden in Boston.

When is the 2022 Men’s Frozen Four?

The Men’s Frozen Four matchups will be played on Thursday, April 7:

Michigan vs. Denver, 5 p.m. ET

Minnesota State vs. Minnesota, 8:30 p.m. ET

"Super fans, franchises, and unique content could be the answer to reducing streaming churn – TechCrunch","In today’s highly competitive streaming market, streaming services don’t just have to figure out how to attract users — they also have to find ways to keep them. Fandom’s “2022 State of Streaming” report may be able to offer some new insights on this front. The report examines fan behavior to uncover key findings such as the reason behind churn, how streaming services can increase retention, and ways to boost subscriber loyalty by differentiating themselves from competitors.

This analysis was conducted by Fandom, a home to entertainment fan communities across TV mobiles, games and more. The company coupled its sizable user data alongside a custom global study. Fandom has more than 300 million monthly visitors and over 250,000 fan-powered wikis.

According to the recent study, 62% of viewers claim that genre is the key differentiator, with Disney+ being the leader in this area. Also, 73% of viewers value streaming services way more if it had films and shows they can’t find anywhere else.

Nineteen percent of consumers don’t have a strong allegiance to one streaming service over the other, as viewer behavior is mainly driven by content, not provider loyalty. This finding indicates that customer retention may live or die based on where they find their next favorite show. (Ask Netflix about this challenge!) And when the market is increasingly expanding with offerings that barely differentiate from each other, it is hardly surprising that consumers become frustrated with the oversaturation.

Another key driver for retention is having a large library, according to 76% of subscribers. Fifty-five percent of users desire original shows and movies.

According to Reelgood, although Amazon’s catalog is the largest, with 2,161 TV shows and 14,670 movies, it has the least number of exclusives out of the major streaming services, with just 38%. Netflix, on the other hand, is in second place, with 83% of its catalog being exclusive to the platform. Disney+ has the most exclusive content. 89% of its content can’t be streamed elsewhere.

Disney+ has its established reputation of Marvel, Pixar, Star Wars, National Geographic, and Disney properties, while other major streaming services such as Apple TV+, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video aren’t yet riddled with franchises or superhero-sized universes.

Super Fans & IP Universes


Consumers are no longer just watching their favorite shows and moving on to the next. In a world of binge-watching and social media, casual fan behavior has evolved into super-fan behavior. Forty-six percent of dedicated fans look for community and culture around their entertainment interests, and 60% dive into online fictional universes.

There are tons of communities online dedicated to fictional universes. In particular, Fandom users placed “Star Wars,” Disney, “Harry Potter,” and Marvel in the top four and considered them as franchises that “foster always-on fan exploration outside of releases,” per the report.

The majority of Disney’s most popular originals have come from the Marvel and “Star Wars” universes, with shows like “The Mandalorian,” “The Book of Boba Fett,” “Loki,” “WandaVision,” “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” and “Hawkeye.” The success of “The Mandalorian,” mainly fueled by the cuteness of Grogu, became one of the most in-demand series in the world. On December 1, 2021, Parrot Analytics stated that “The Mandalorian” was 31.9 times more in-demand than the average title on a global basis.

Fandom’s user data shows that Disney+ has a +30% higher value than an average video streaming service. Disney’s huge umbrella of universes and characters has resulted in a fanfiction community unlike any other. Disney adults could single-handedly take over the Internet. Ok, not actually. But it is amusing to think about all those Mickey hats.

In addition, Disney’s fan fiction community grew +45% during the “Encanto” release, with the Encanto FanFiction page ranking as the number one trending page during the week of its streaming release. The soundtrack, in particular, was a hit everywhere, especially on TikTok, and if you didn’t have “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” stuck in your head for a week, well then, you’re one of the lucky ones. The popular song, written and composed by Lin-Manuel Miranda, became the first Disney song to top the UK Singles Chart. It is also Billboard’s highest-charting Disney song, peaking at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Meanwhile, Netflix is desperately trying to find new IP. Last year, the company acquired the Roald Dahl Story Company in hopes of creating “a unique universe across animated and live-action films and TV, publishing, games, immersive experiences, live theatre, consumer products, and more,” Netflix wrote in its blog.

Amazon is also focused on IP with universe potential. The company has heavily invested in “The Lord of the Rings” and its ownership of the “James Bond” franchise through its $8.5 billion MGM acquisition.

Karol Severin, co-founder and entertainment/tech analyst at research company MIDiA said,

“It is easier for competitors to commission ‘something similar‘ to a single film or a TV Show than it is to replicate the depth of an IP universe. For these reasons, we believe IP universes will continue to play an increasing role.“

Streaming services have the opportunity to reduce churn and potentially “win” the streaming wars by driving loyalty and creating a full fan experience with unique content and franchises. Thus, streaming services need to increase the titles that lend themselves to additional storytelling, rather than independent stories which only work as a one-off movies or series.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/23/super-fans-franchises-and-unique-content-could-be-the-answer-to-reducing-streaming-churn/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bnhvbfgetFI.webp?w=711,TechCrunch
DJ and crypto startup founder 3LAU explains the value behind music NFTs – TechCrunch,"When people think of NFTs, the first use case most of them likely think of is visual art. From Beeple’s $69 million sale of a digital collage at Christie’s to the Bored Apes Yacht Club collection, visual art has seemed to be most prominent use case for NFTs due to close similarities with traditional fine art investing. The fact that digital art can be viewed and replicated endlessly online has led to some confusion for plenty of consumers with what exactly they’re buying, however.

“The idea that someone can just say, ‘hey, this is mine now, I just saved the image to my laptop, and I’m using it as my background,’ — it seems really obvious. But then when there’s a real, true owner, and you can validate that on-chain, it makes that other person look kind of foolish, at least within the web3 community,” DJ and NFT art collector Justin Blau explained in an interview on the TechCrunch podcast Chain Reaction.

Blau, who is better known by his stage name, 3LAU, co-founded Royal, a startup that uses NFTs to allow users to buy “shares” of songs through its marketplace and earn royalties as those songs gain popularity. The company raised a $55 million Series A round from Andreessen Horowitz’s crypto investment arm last November, less than three months after bagging $16 million in seed funding led by Founders Fund and Paradigm.

NFTs sold on Royal represent two things, Blau said. First, they represent the intrinsic value of copyright ownership, and second, the emotional value of owning something scarce that’s associated with your favorite artist. Blau sees utility in use cases for NFTs beyond the visual art world, but said he doesn’t think the same form factor and manifestation for those NFTs will apply to every different form of media.




“I think the music example is specifically the most interesting, where collecting an actual audio file for thousands and thousands of dollars just doesn’t seem to make sense, because no one would do that in the real world,” Blau said.



As an independent artist himself, Blau shared the example of his song “Is It Love,” saying that he turned down a deal that would have paid him $15,000 for 50% ownership of the song, which he said ended up taking off and generating upwards of $700,000 in revenue.

“My fans probably would have given me a better deal. They probably would have been willing to pay more than the $15,000 … and should that song have succeeded, they all would have had some sort of return — both from a pure asset value appreciation standpoint and from a cash flow standpoint,” Blau said.

Royal’s platform will eventually allow digital asset holders to be able to engage directly with artists and access exclusive perks, such as token-gated shows, he noted.

"Scammers snatch up expired domains, vexing Google – TechCrunch","The web is a living thing — ever-evolving, ever-changing. This goes beyond just the content on websites; whole domains can expire and be taken over, allowing corners of the internet to become a little like your hometown: Wait, wasn’t there a Dairy Queen here?

For example, if TechCrunch forgets to pay its domain registrar, TechCrunch.com would eventually expire (on June 10, to be exact). At that point, some enterprising human could snap up the domain and do nefarious things with it. Now, if TechCrunch.com was suddenly red instead of green and sold penis enhancement pills instead of dicking around with great news and awful puns in equal measure, you’d probably figure out that something is up. But black-hat SEO tricksters are subtler than that.

When they seize a domain, they’ll often point the web domain to a new IP address, resurrect the site, and restore it to as close as it can to the original, and leave it for a while. When the IP address changes, SEO experts claim that Google temporarily “punishes” the domain by dropping it in the rankings.

This is called “sandboxing,” or “the sandbox period,” and during this time, Google puts the domain on notice. Once Google determines — sometimes erroneously — that the IP address change underneath the domain was just part of a move from one web host to another, the theory is that the domain will start climbing in the rankings again. That’s when the new owner of the domain can start their sneaky business: Updating links to send traffic to new places for example, or keeping the traffic as it is and adding affiliate links to make money off its visitors. At the far end of the scamming spectrum, they can use the good name and reputation of the original business to scam or trick users.

Since the invention of PageRank in 1996, Google has been relying in part on the transferability of trust to determine what makes a good website. A site that is linked to by a lot of high-trust websites can, generally, be trusted. Links from that page can, in turn, be used as a measure of trust as well. Massively simplified, it boils down to this: The more links from high-quality sites a page has, the more it is trusted, and the better it ranks in the search engines.

You don’t have to dig deep to find examples of domains that, at first glance, look legitimate, but that have been sneakily shifted to another purpose.

While bad actors can take advantage of this fact, it’s also just something that happens on the internet — sites move from one host to another all the time for perfectly legitimate reasons. As Google’s Search Liaison, Danny Sullivan, pointed out when I talked to him about expired domains last week, TechCrunch itself has had a few changes of owners over the years, from AOL, to Oath, to Verizon Media, to Yahoo, which itself was bought by Apollo Global Management last year. Every time that that happens, there’s a chance that the new corporate overlords want to move stuff to new servers or new technology, which means that the IP addresses will change.

“If you were to purchase a site — even TechCrunch; I think it was AOL who bought you guys — the domain registry would have changed, but the site itself didn’t change the nature of what it was doing, the content that it was presenting, or the way that it was operating. [Google] can understand if domain names change ownership,” Sullivan said, pointing out that it’s also possible for the content to change without the underlying architecture or network topography shifting. “The site could rebrand, but just because it rebranded itself doesn’t mean that the basic functions of what it was doing had changed.”

The buying and selling of expired domains

You don’t have to look far to find places to buy expired domains. Serp.Domains, Odys, Spamzilla, and Juice Market are some of the most active in the business. (As a side note, I stuck a rel=""nofollow"" on all three of those links in the HTML of this article. They ain’t getting TechCrunch’s sweet, sweet link juice on my watch; as Google notes in its developer documentation; “Use the nofollow value when … you’d rather Google not associate your site with … the linked page.”)

“Get expired domains that have naturally gained (almost impossible to get) authoritative backlinks since they were actual businesses,” Odys advertises on its site, adding that they “are aged and out of the sandbox period by a mile, [and] already have organic, referral & direct, type-in traffic.”

These domains are listed for sale for anything from a few hundred bucks to thousands of dollars. Seeing the sites disappear from the “for sale” list and then pop up on the internet shows that some of these domains end up ethically dubious at best and scams at worst.

It’s pretty easy to determine why so-called “black hat SEO” folks are willing to go through all the trouble: Building a domain from scratch, filling it with high-quality content, waiting for people to link to it, and doing everything by the book takes for-flippin’-ever. Finding a shortcut that shaves months, if not years, off the process and adds the ability to make a quick buck? There will always be people who are willing to go for that sort of thing.

“Google has named inbound links as one of their top three ranking factors,” explained Patrick Stox, a product adviser at Ahrefs. “Content is going to be the most important, but your relevant links will provide a strength metric for them.”

What the spammers are doing

The spammers buy a domain that was recently expired and use a search engine optimization (SEO) tool like Ahrefs to gauge how valuable the site is; it checks how many links are going to the site and how valuable those links are. A link from TechCrunch or the BBC or WhiteHouse.gov would be highly valuable, for example. A link from a random blog post on Medium.com is probably less so.

Once they’ve found and bought a domain, they’ll use something like the WayBack Machine to copy an old version of the site, stick it on a server somewhere, and — voila! — the site is back. Obviously, that’s both trademark and copyright infringement, but if you’re in the market of spamming or scamming, that’s probably the least of your crimes against human decency, never mind the letter of the law.

Over time — sometimes weeks, sometimes months — Google un-sandboxes the domain and is effectively tricked into accepting the domain as the original. Traffic will start picking up, and black-hat SEO wizards are ready for the next phase of their plan: selling stuff or tricking people. There are whole guides for what to do next in order to use these domains, including checking whether there are trademarks registered and redirecting either the full domain or specific pages on the domain using a so-called 301 redirect (“moved permanently”).

“When a site drops off the internet [Google is] just going to drop all the signals from the links. That typically happens anyway when a page expires. Where it’s more complicated is going to be whether any of those signals will come back for a new owner. I don’t think [Google has] ever really answered this in a very clear way,” Stox explained. “But if the same site with the same type of content — or very similar content — comes back, it is more than likely the links are going to start counting again. If you were a site about technology and now suddenly you’re a food blog, all of the previous stuff will likely be ignored.”


“It’s interesting because sometimes penalties will still carry over, regardless of the content of the new site,” Stox said. “So certain things may still factor in. There’s a giant list of Google penalties — such as backlink spam, content spam, paid links, etc. They can carry on to the new site, and sometimes people will buy … an expired domain and put a new site up. Nothing is ranking, and on closer inspection, they’ll find a penalty set in inside Google Search Console.”

Sullivan reassured us that the search engine giant knows what’s going on and that it has a handle on things.

“It’s not just fair to say that all purchased sites are spam and that they, therefore, should be treated as spam,” said Sullivan, pointing out that the company’s robust spam filters are there to protect searchers. “When actual spam happens, we have a whole ton of spam-fighting systems we have in place. There are millions and millions, if not hundreds of millions of [pages and sites] that we’re constantly keeping out of the top search results. One metaphor I like to use for people to understand just how much work we do on spam is this: If you go into your email spam folder, you go, ‘Wow, I didn’t see all these emails.’ That is stuff that existed but didn’t show up because your system said, ‘No, this isn’t really relevant for you. This is spam.’ That’s what’s happening on search all the time. If we didn’t have robust spam filters in place, our search results would look like what you see in your spam folder. There’s so much spam and our systems are in place to catch it.”

There’s no doubt that Google does a lot to defend us from spam, and yet there’s a thriving industry for high-value expired domains that are available, whether for honest attempts at corner-cutting or more nefarious deeds.

A thriving industry

You don’t have to dig very deep to find examples of domains that, at first glance, look legitimate, but that have been sneakily shifted to another purpose. Here are a few I came across.

One example is the Paid Leave Project, which used to live on paidleaveproject.org, but moved its site to USpaidleave.org at some point. Unfortunately, someone at the org didn’t renew and/or redirect the old domain, and the site that used to work hard to ensure that workers in the U.S. can get paid family leave is now, well … helping families grow in different ways:

Another tragic story is Genome Mag, which ran from 2013 to 2016, expired, and then came back online as a different magazine that the original owner doesn’t have control over.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/23/seo-scammers-buy-expired-domains-vexing-google-trust/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/dead-website-scammer.jpg?w=711,TechCrunch
Reliance says its $3.4 billion deal with Future Group ‘cannot be implemented’ – TechCrunch,"Reliance Industries “cannot implement” its $3.4 billion deal to acquire parts of retail chain Future Group after the latter’s secured creditors rejected the offer earlier this week, India’s most valuable firm said in a stock exchange filing on Saturday.

“The Future Group companies comprising Future Retail Limited (FRL) and other listed companies involved in the scheme have intimated the results of the voting on the scheme of arrangement by their shareholders and creditors at their respective meetings. As per these results, the shareholders and unsecured creditors of FRL have voted in favour of the scheme. But the secured creditors of FRL have voted against the scheme. In view thereof, the subject scheme of arrangement cannot be implemented,” Reliance Industries said (PDF).

The remarkable announcement is the latest in a two-year-long battle between Reliance and Future — that run two of India’s largest retail chains — and e-commerce giant Amazon, which has sought to block the deal.

Amazon, which had invested in one of Future Group’s units three years ago, last month accused Future Group and Reliance Industries of indulging in fraudulent practices, saying the Indian firms did not comply with court orders and have attempted to “remove the substratum of the dispute.”

Amazon has argued that Future Group has violated its contract by doing a deal with Reliance and earlier approached the Singapore arbitrator to halt the deal between the Indian firms. The ensuing legal battle delayed the completion of the deal, during which Future Group’s debt piled up and earned a once-iconic Indian company a “non-performing asset” evaluation from lenders.

As Amazon and Future fought in courts, Reliance began taking over several of Future stores starting in February after brokering deals with landowners in a move that stunningly blindsided and outwitted the U.S. firm. Cash-strapped Future said in a filing that it could not pay rent at many outlets and was scaling down its operations. The episode further lowered the confidence many bankers had on Future.

Without secured lenders’s backing, Future Group, which has more than $4 billion in debt on its books, cannot proceed with the deal, and now is unlikely to survive. Last year, the National Company Law Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body in India that adjudicates issues relating to Indian companies, permitted Future Retail and other group companies to convene meetings of shareholders and creditors to take a vote on the proposed acquisition to Reliance Industries.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/23/reliance-says-its-3-4-billion-deal-with-future-group-cannot-be-implemented/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/GettyImages-94841420.jpg?w=605,TechCrunch
Europe seals a deal on tighter rules for digital services – TechCrunch,"In the small hours local time, European Union lawmakers secured a provisional deal on a landmark update to rules for digital services operating in the region — grabbing political agreement after a final late night/early morning of compromise talks on the detail of what is a major retooling of the bloc’s existing ecommerce rulebook.

The political agreement on the Digital Services Act (DSA) paves the way for formal adoption in the coming weeks and the legislation entering into force — likely later this year. Although the rules won’t start to apply until 15 months after that — so there’s a fairly long lead in time to allow companies to adapt.

The regulation is wide ranging — setting out to harmonize content moderation and other governance rules to speed up the removal of illegal content and products. It addresses a grab-bag of consumer protection and privacy concerns, as well as introducing algorithmic accountability requirements for large platforms to dial up societal accountability around their services. While ‘KYC’ requirements are intended to do the same for online marketplaces.

How effective the package will be is of course tbc but the legislation that’s was agreed today goes further than the Commission proposal in a number of areas — with, for example, the European Parliament pushing to add in limits on tracking-based advertising.

A prohibition on the use of so-called ‘dark patterns’ for online platforms is also included — but not, it appears, a full blanket ban for all types of digital service (per details of the final text shared with TechCrunch via our sources).

See below for a fuller breakdown of what we know so far about what’s been agreed.

The DSA was presented as a draft proposal by the Commission back in December 2020 which means it’s taken some 16 months of discussion — looping in the other branches of the EU: the directly elected European Parliament and the Council, which represents EU Member States’ governments — to reach this morning’s accord.

After last month’s deal on the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which selectively targets the most powerful intermediating platforms (aka gatekeepers) with an ex ante, pro-competition regime, EU policy watchers may be forgiven for a little euphoria at the (relative) speed with which substantial updates to digital rules are being agreed.

Big Tech’s lobbying of the EU over this period has been of an unprecedented scale in monetary terms. Notably, giants like Google have also sought to insert themselves into the ‘last mile’ stage of discussions where EU institutions are supposed to shut themselves off from external pressures to reach a compromise, as a report published earlier today by Corporate Europe Observatory underlines. That illustrates what they believe is at stake.


The Commission’s mantra for the DSA has always been that the goal is to ensure that what’s illegal offline will be illegal online. And in a video message tweeted out in the small hours local time, a tired but happy looking EVP, Margrethe Vestager, said it’s “not a slogan anymore that’s what illegal offline should also be seen and dealt with online”.

“Now it is a real thing,” she added. “Democracy’s back.”

It’s a wrap! We have a deal on the #DSA! Two years after we tabled the proposal 🙏 @SchaldemoseMEP and @cedric_o – and our amazing teams – for great cooperation 🇪🇺 pic.twitter.com/8V8xE5Yw7w — Margrethe Vestager (@vestager) April 23, 2022

In a statement, Commission president Ursula von der Leyen added:

“Today’s agreement on the Digital Services Act is historic, both in terms of speed and of substance. The DSA will upgrade the ground-rules for all online services in the EU. It will ensure that the online environment remains a safe space, safeguarding freedom of expression and opportunities for digital businesses. It gives practical effect to the principle that what is illegal offline, should be illegal online. The greater the size, the greater the responsibilities of online platforms. Today’s agreement — complementing the political agreement on the Digital Markets Act last month — sends a strong signal: to all Europeans, to all EU businesses, and to our international counterparts.”

In its own press release, the Council called the DSA “a world first in the field of digital regulation”.

While the parliament said the “landmark rules… effectively tackle the spread of illegal content online and protect people’s fundamental rights in the digital sphere”.

In a statement, its rapporteur for the file, MEP Christel Schaldemose, further suggested the DSA will “set new global standards”, adding: “Citizens will have better control over how their data are used by online platforms and big tech-companies. We have finally made sure that what is illegal offline is also illegal online. For the European Parliament, additional obligations on algorithmic transparency and disinformation are important achievements. These new rules also guarantee more choice for users and new obligations for platforms on targeted ads, including bans to target minors and restricting data harvesting for profiling.”

Other EU lawmakers are fast dubbing the DSA a “European constitution for the Internet”. And it’s hard not to see the gap between the EU and the US on comprehensive digital lawmaking as increasingly gaping.

Vestager’s victory message notably echoes encouragement tweeted out earlier this week by the former US secretary of state, senator, first lady and presidential candidate, Hillary Clinton, who urged Europe to get the DSA across the line and “bolster global democracy before it’s too late”, as she put it, adding: “For too long, tech platforms have amplified disinformation and extremism with no accountability. The EU is poised to do something about it.”

DSA: What’s been agreed?

In their respective press releases trumpeting the deal, the parliament and Council have provided an overview of areas of key elements of the regulation they’ve agreed.

It’s worth emphasizing that the full and final text hasn’t been published yet — and won’t be for a while. It’s pending legal checks and translation into the bloc’s many languages — which means the full detail of the regulation and the implication of all its nuance remains tbc.

But here’s an overview of what we know so far…

Scope, supervision & penalties

On scope, the Council says the DSA will apply to all online intermediaries providing services in the EU.

The regulation’s obligations are intended to be proportionate to the nature of the services concerned and the number of users — with extra, “more stringent” requirements for “very large online platforms” (aka VLOPs) and very large online search engines (VLOSEs).

Services with more than 45M monthly active users in the EU will be considered VLOPs or VLOSEs. So plenty of services will reach that bar — including, for example, the homegrown music streaming giant Spotify.

“To safeguard the development of start-ups and smaller enterprises in the internal market, micro and small enterprises with under 45 million monthly active users in the EU will be exempted from certain new obligations,” the Council adds.

The Commission itself will be responsible for supervising VLOPs and VLOSEs for the obligations that are specific to them — which is intended to avoid bottlenecks in oversight and enforcements of larger platforms (such as happened with the EU’s GDPR).

But national agencies at the Member State level will supervise the wider scope of the DSA — so EU lawmakers say this arrangement maintains the country-of-origin principle that’s baked into existing digital rules.

Penalties for breaches of the DSA can scale up to 6% of global annual turnover.

Per the parliament, there will also be a right for recipients of digital services to seek redress for any damages or loss suffered due to infringements by platforms.

Content moderation & marketplace rules

The content moderation measures are focused on harmonizing rules to ensure “swift” removal of illegal content.

This is being done through what the parliament describes as a “clearer ‘notice and action’ procedure” — where “users will be empowered to report illegal content online and online platforms will have to act quickly”, as it puts it.

It also flags support for victims of cyber violence — who it says will be “better protected especially against non-consensual sharing (revenge porn) with immediate takedowns”.

MEPs say fundamental rights are protected from the risk of over-removal of content from the regulation putting pressure on platforms to act quickly through “stronger safeguards to ensure notices are processed in a non-arbitrary and non-discriminatory manner and with respect for fundamental rights, including the freedom of expression and data protection”.

The regulation is also intended to ensure swift removal of illegal products/services from online marketplaces. So there are new requirements incoming for ecommerce players.

On this, the Council says the DSA will impose a “duty of care” on marketplaces vis-à-vis sellers who sell products or services on their online platforms.

“Marketplaces will in particular have to collect and display information on the products and services sold in order to ensure that consumers are properly informed,” it notes, although there will be plenty of devil in the detail of the exact provisions.

On this, the parliament says marketplaces will “have to ensure that consumers can purchase safe products or services online by strengthening checks to prove that the information provided by traders is reliable (‘Know Your Business Customer’ principle) and make efforts to prevent illegal content appearing on their platforms, including through random checks”.

Random checks on traders/goods had been pushed for by consumer protection organizations — who had been concerned the measure would be dropped during trilogues — so EU lawmakers appear to have listened to those concerns.

Extra obligations for VLOPs/VLOSEs

These larger platform entities will face scrutiny of how their algorithms work from the European Commission and Member State agencies — which the parliament says will both have access to the algorithms of VLOPs.

The DSA also introduces an obligation for very large digital platforms and services to analyse “systemic risks they create” and to carry out “risk reduction analysis”, per the Council.

The analysis must be done annually — which the Council suggests will allow for monitoring of and reduced risks in areas such as the dissemination of illegal content; adverse effects on fundamental rights; manipulation of services having an impact on democratic processes and public security; adverse effects on gender-based violence, and on minors and serious consequences for the physical or mental health of users.

Additionally, VLOPs/VLOSEs will be subject to independent audits each year, per the parliament.

Large platforms that use algorithms to determine what content users see (aka “recommender systems”) will have to provide at least one option that is not based on profiling. Albeit, many already do — although they often also undermine these choices by applying dark pattern techniques to nudge users away from control over their feeds so holistic supervision will be needed to meaningfully improve user agency.

There will also be transparency requirements for the parameters of these recommender systems with the goal of improving information for users and any choices they make. Again, the detail will be interesting to see there.

Limits on targeted advertising

Restrictions on tracking-based advertising appear to have survived the trilogue process with all sides reaching agreement on a ban on processing minors’ data for targeted ads.

This applies to platforms accessible to minors “when they are aware that a user is a minor”, per the Council.

“Platforms will be prohibited from presenting targeted advertising based on the use of minors’ personal data as defined in EU law,” it adds.

A final compromise text shared with TechCrunch by our sources suggests the DSA will stipulate that providers of online platforms should not do profile based advertising “when they are aware with reasonable certainty that the recipient of the service is a minor”.

A restriction on the use of sensitive data for targets ads has also made it into the text.

The parliament sums this up by saying “targeted advertising is banned when it comes to sensitive data (e.g. based on sexual orientation, religion, ethnicity)”.

The wording of the final compromise text which we’ve seen states that: “Providers of online platforms shall not present advertising to recipients of the service based on profiling within the meaning of Article 4(4) of Regulation 2016/679 [aka, the GDPR] using special categories of personal data as referred to in article 9(1) of Regulation 2016/679.”

Article 4(4) of the GDPR defines ‘profiling’ as: “any form of automated processing of personal data consisting of the use of personal data to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, in particular to analyse or predict aspects concerning that natural person’s performance at work, economic situation, health, personal preferences, interests, reliability, behaviour, location or movements;”.

While the GDPR defines special category data as personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, as well as biometric and health data, data on sex life and/or sexual orientation.

So targeting ads based on tracking or inferring users’ sensitive interests is — on paper — facing a hard ban in the DSA.

Ban on use of dark patterns

A prohibition on dark patterns also made it into the text. But, as we understand it, this only applies to “online platforms” — so it does not look like a blanket ban across all types of apps and digital services.

That is unfortunate. Unethical practices shouldn’t be acceptable no matter the size of the business.

On dark patterns, the parliament says: “Online platforms and marketplaces should not nudge people into using their services, for example by giving more prominence to a particular choice or urging the recipient to change their choice via interfering pop-ups. Moreover, cancelling a subscription for a service should become as easy as subscribing to it.”

The wording of the final compromise text that we’ve seen says that: “Providers of online platforms shall not design, organize or operate their online interfaces in a way that deceives, manipulates or otherwise materially distorts or impairs the ability of recipients of their service to make free and informed decisions” — after which there’s an exemption for practices already covered by Directive 2005/29/EC [aka the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive] and by the GDPR.

The final compromise text we reviewed further notes that the Commission may issue guidance on specific practices — such as platforms giving more prominence to certain choices, repeatedly requesting a user makes a choice after they already have and making it harder to terminate a service than sign up. So the effectiveness of the dark pattern ban could well come down to how much attention the Commission is willing to give to a massively widespread online problem.

The wording of the associated recital in the final compromise we saw also specifies that the dark pattern ban (only) applies for “intermediary services”.

Crisis mechanism

An entirely new article was also added to the DSA following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — and in connection with rising concern around the impact of online disinformation — that creates a crisis response mechanism which will give the Commission extra powers to scrutinize VLOPs/VLOSEs in order to analyze the impact of their activities to the crisis in question.

The EU’s executive will also be able to come up with what the Council bills as “proportionate and effective measures to be put in place for the respect of fundamental rights”.

Alphabet-owned Intrinsic is acquiring fellow robotic software firm Vicarious – TechCrunch,"Alphabet X-birthed Intrinsic made its big debut last September. The subsidiary looks to buck its parent company’s somewhat spotty robotics record with a software-first approach. Specifically, the company is looking to make manufacturing robots more intelligent — a concept that no doubt excites many in the space amid pandemic-fueled demand for automation.

Today it made its second big piece of news: an acquisition. Intrinsic is acquiring fellow AI/robotic intelligence firm Vicarious. The Bay Area-based firm has been kicking for a dozen or so years, raising a healthy $250 million in that time from big names like Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, Mark Zuckerberg and Samsung. The company describes its tech as, “a turnkey robotics solutions integrator using AI to automate tasks too complex and versatile for traditional automation.” That includes standard warehouse and logistics tasks like palletizing, picking and packing.

The deal finds CEO Scott Phoenix coming on board as CCO, while a small team from the firm led by Vicarious CTO Dileep George will actually be joining the DeepMind research team. In the initial Intrinsic announcement post, CEO Wendy Tan-White noted that the company has been collaborating with teams throughout Alphabet — and that certainly appears to be the case here.

“For more than a decade, Vicarious has been pushing the boundaries of intelligent robotics and AI across multiple industries with visionary customers, building an interdisciplinary team and unique culture in the process,” Tan-White said in a post. “We believe that combining our efforts will help us solve industry problems faster and accelerate our shared mission.”

Intrinsic has mostly stayed silent since its launch, opting instead to focus on building out some technology pilots with real-world manufacturing firms. That’s likely to continue to be the case, as the announcement doesn’t offer much more information on the deal. Though Tan-White promises more details, “in the coming months.”",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/alphabet-owned-intrinsic-is-acquiring-fellow-robotic-software-firm-vicarious/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Screen-Shot-2022-04-22-at-7.02.03-PM.jpg?w=748,TechCrunch
15 carbon removal projects score $1M each in climate Xprize milestone – TechCrunch,"A multi-year, $100 million Xprize competition for startups trying to remove or reverse carbon emissions has its first crop of big winners. Though the bulk of this Musk money won’t be given away until 2025, these 15 companies are each getting $1M today to keep the lights on til then.

The Carbon Removal Xprize, funded by the Musk Foundation, aims to reward novel methods to “pull carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere or oceans and lock it away permanently in an environmentally benign way.” We’ve seen a few companies doing this with venture funding as well; it’s clearly an important and potentially both transformative and profitable space.

Of course Xprize isn’t looking for profitability, but rather demonstrating and executing on an idea, which means things are generally a bit more early stage. The last year saw the reviewers winnowing down an original pool of more than a thousand applicants to a top 60 and eventually these 15, based on “scientific validity… operations plans, performance data, life cycle analysis and cost estimates.”

Here’s a very basic summary of each, in the order listed on the Xprize site:

Calcite: Using “the natural carbon absorbing properties of Calcium Hydroxide” to pull it from the air at scale

Carbyon: “A fast swing process by means of a rotating drum” containing an engineered material to capture CO2

Heirloom + Carbfix: Sequestering carbon in naturally occurring minerals and fluids through efficient exposure

Project Hajar: Mineralization using 44.01’s peridotite injection process

Sustaera: “Direct air capture 2.0” with improved modularity and cheaper chemical reaction pathways

Verdox + Carbfix (yes, they’re listed twice): “Electroswing adsorption” to fix CO2 with 70% less energy

Bioeconomy Institute at ISU: Uses Pyrolysis to refix outgoing plant-based carbon (with bio-oil byproduct)

Global Algae: Algae farms that naturally capture CO2 from the air

NetZero: Also pyrolysis (helpful video explainer here)

PlantVillage: Helps farmers in Africa to adapt to climate change

Takachar: Mobile “oxygen-lean torrefaction” to convert waste biomass to fuel, fertilizer etc

Captura: Extracting CO2 directly from seawater by means unspecified

Marine Permaculture: “Deepwater-irrigated, open-ocean seaweed mariculture.” Kelp farms!

Planetary: Turns mine waste into a “mild, nontoxic antacid” that helps restore natural ocean pH

Carbin Minerals: Using mine tailings for a mineralization process

Now that these milestone winners have been announced, the “real” competition begins. Registration will remain open until the end of 2023, and then teams have until 2025 to demonstrate actual removal of 1,000 tons of carbon per year, with cost modeling of removing a million, and a plan to go beyond even that. Earth Day 2025 will be the date the winners are announced, with $50M for first place, $20M for second, and $10M for third.

Block Head Jack Dorsey tells us what we already knew – TechCrunch,"Jack Dorsey, the Twitter co-founder and current Block CEO, is no longer the payments firm’s “chief executive officer.” Instead, the executive is choosing to call himself “Block Head and Chairperson.” It’s an unconventional title, sure, but it is perhaps fitting for the billionaire man, who is not known for his choice of words.

A very real regulatory filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission reflects how no, this play on the term “blockhead” is not a joke. Yet like Elon Musk — who declared himself “Technoking” in March 2021 — the change may indeed be for the lolz.

“There will be no changes in Mr. Dorsey’s roles and responsibilities, and he will continue to serve as principal executive officer of the Company,” the filing reads. Brutally, the filing also notes that the change was made “at his request.”",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/jack-dorsey-is-a-block-head/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GettyImages-1321753430.jpg?w=634,TechCrunch

4 questions every CISO should be asking about the metaverse

The metaverse is still taking shape, but it’s already creating headaches for cybersecurity professionals.

Technology that places users inside virtual, immersive environments where they can transact could unlock untold benefits, but it will definitely create a threat attack surface of titanic proportions. To prepare, CSO/CISO David Fairman says organizations must be able to answer these questions:

Can we protect PII (and other sensitive data) in the metaverse?

How can I authenticate users?

Can we protect users from bullying, harassment and exploitation?

Can we manage this kind of fast-growing attack surface?

NLRB rules Activision Blizzard’s first union at Raven Software can vote for recognition – TechCrunch,"The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) ruled today that the first union at a major U.S. gaming company can file for a formal union election.


Usually, when this happens, the union can file for an election with the National Labor Board of Relations (NLRB), and if over 50% of eligible employees vote to unionize, then the company is legally required to recognize and bargain with them. But in the case of Raven Software, who formed the Game Workers Alliance through the Communication Workers of America (CWA), their parent company attempted to stop the union from even getting to a vote.

When the Game Workers Alliance filed for an election, Activision Blizzard tried to block the election by claiming that any union must include all 230 employees, which would make it much harder for the union to win the vote in an eventual election. But the NLRB ruled today that the 21-member department can hold a union election separate from the rest of Raven Software.

“We are disappointed that a decision that could significantly impact the future of our entire studio will be made by fewer than 10% of our employees,” a spokesperson from Activision Blizzard told TechCrunch. “We believe a direct relationship with team members is the best path to achieving individual and company goals.”

The spokesperson added that Activision Blizzard is reviewing legal options and may file an appeal to today’s ruling.

Before announcing their intent to unionize in January, Raven Software QA testers — who mostly work on “Call of Duty” — had been on strike for five weeks, protesting the early termination of twelve contractors, or about a third of the department.


Activision Blizzard has made some effort to improve working conditions since then — earlier this month, Activision Blizzard converted about 1100 QA contractors to full-time staffers and increased the minimum wage to $20 per hour. But Activision Blizzard claimed that, due to laws under the National Labor Relations Act, the company wasn’t allowed to change the pay rate of its employees in the midst of a union effort. The CWA, however, said that this was a “disingenuous” attempt at union busting.

“We are pleased that after reviewing the evidence, the National Labor Relations Board rejected Raven Software management’s attempts to undermine our efforts to form a union,” members of the Game Workers Alliance-CWA said on Friday. “It’s now time for Raven management to stop trying to prevent us from exercising our rights. We are looking forward to voting for – and winning – our union.”

Assuming all goes as planned, the Raven Software QA testers’ union election will take place via mail between April 29 and May 20.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/activision-blizzard-union-vote-raven-software/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/GettyImages-1085037702.jpg?w=600,TechCrunch
Report reveals Big Tech’s last minute lobbying to weaken EU rules – TechCrunch,"A new report has peeled back the curtain on big tech’s frenzied lobbying of European Union lawmakers as they finalize a major series of updates to the bloc’s digital rulebook.

It reveals some of the arguments used by tech giants including Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta (Facebook) and Spotify to press their interests behind the scenes in a bid to reshape key components of the EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) and Digital Services Act (DSA) — targeting areas such as surveillance advertising and access to platform data for researchers — with the clear intent of shielding their processes and business models from measures that could weaken their market power.

The report, which is based on lobbying documents obtained by civil society groups Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness via freedom of information requests, also highlights how tech giants have ramped up their spending on regional lobbying since the DMA and DSA were proposed back in December 2020 — with the big five collectively spending over €27M (close to $30M) last year alone.

It concludes with a series of recommendations for how policymakers can better protect the democratic process from undue influence by the best resourced corporate giants.

Spend, spend, spend!

Citing publicly disclosed data, the report shows that Apple has increased its spending on EU lobbying the most — almost doubling how much it’s shelling out from €3.5M in 2020 to €6.5M in 2021, meaning it also pulled into the lead among platform peers for total regional lobbying spend last year.

Facebook (Meta) had the next biggest increase, growing the size of its EU lobbying budget from €5.5M in 2020 to €6M in 2021. Google also topped up its outlay from €5.8M in 2020 to €6M. While Amazon and Microsoft both made similar increases in regional spending over this period.

The DMA, which gained political agreement last month, will apply only to the largest and most powerful intermediary platforms — so called “gatekeepers”; a designation that’s likely to apply to the five ‘big spenders’ in the above chart — introducing a set of operational obligations these giants must abide by up-front.

The pan-EU regulation, which is expected to come into force in October, aims to reboot competition in digital markets dominated by gatekeepers and ensure they remain open and fair.

Its sister regulation — the DSA — applies more broadly, setting rules for all sorts of digital services which are intended to harmonize online approaches to tackling illegal content and products. This means it touches on areas like content moderation, consumer protection and transparency. And while it applies across digital services a subset of so-called “very large online platforms” (aka VLOPs) will be subject to additional oversight under the regulation — meaning that tech giants will face additional DSA compliance hurdles vs smaller players.

At the time of writing the DSA is still pending political agreement — although a deal is expected after Friday’s (April 22) trilogue meeting — so the impact of big tech’s lobbying on EU policymaking should become clearer in the coming days.

So what have tech giants been spending their millions on lobbying for as EU lawmakers finalize the DSA and DMA?

Read on for a breakdown of their focus areas from the report…

Surveillance advertising

One major target for Big Tech lobbyists, per the report, has been around surveillance advertising as tech giants marshalled their millions to block off an attempt to get an outright ban on tracking-based advertising into EU legislation.

They succeeded in that goal as an earlier push by some MEPs for an outright ban did not gain full backing of the parliament so did not make it into the trilogue discussions. But the European Parliament did vote to incorporate limits on tracking ads into both the DSA and the DMA — with MEPs backing a ban on processing of minors’ data for targeting ads and a ban on use of sensitive categories of personal data.

However the Council position diverged from parliament, toeing closer to the Commission’s original proposal — which had merely suggested ads transparency requirements — so tech giants sought to exploit this to try to water down restrictions on tracking ads, per the report.

Documents obtained for the report show that Google directly lobbied the Commission in a series of high level meetings with top commissioners between November and early January in which the adtech giant raised concerns about the European Parliament’s proposals on advertising — suggesting limits on trackings would be detrimental to SMEs and harm news publishers.

“This marked a continuation of Google and Facebook’s strategy throughout the whole discussion on new digital regulations — trying to reframe it away from Big Tech’s immense profits and business model and to instead hype up potential negative impacts for smaller businesses and consumers,” the report notes. “As Google’s leaked lobbying strategy showed, one of its priorities was to focus the discussion on the costs to the economy and consumers.”

Between January to the end of March, lobby documents show that Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government — arguing on four different occasions against Parliament’s proposal to ban advertising targeted at minors and other limits, per the report. “Their recommendation to national governments was to ‘support the Council / Commission position (i.e. no restraints on targeted ads’). Google argued ‘that the DSA is not the right forum to deal with these issues’,” it adds.

There’s a special irony here given Google also led big tech lobbying efforts to delay an update to the bloc’s ePrivacy rules — which explicitly cover tracking technologies like cookies. That update remains stalled even now (the Commission proposal was presented all the way back in January 2017!). So if the tech giant were to have its way there would, it seems, be no ‘appropriate’ legal forum to rein in its surveillance ads empire. Funny that! 🙄

But as it turns out, EU lawmakers in the Council and Parliament were able to agree — through the trilogue process — on including limits to tracking ads.

At least that was the position announced last month, at the moment of political agreement on the DMA.


6⃣ Ban on targeted advertising for children 🚫



More #protection against targeted advertising aimed at children — or based on sensitive data.#DSA — Thierry Breton (@ThierryBreton) April 22, 2022

Under the political deal reached between EU co-legislators last month, the DMA requires gatekeepers to gain explicit consent from users to combine their personal data for advertising.

But the French presidency of the Council also said then that they had agreed complementary provisions to limit tracking ads would also be included in the text of the DSA (still to be agreed via trilogue) — signalling that the parliament’s goal of limits on processing children’s data for ads or using sensitive data for ads would make it into EU law.

So what did Google’s lobbyists do next? According to the report, the tech giant continued pushing against any/all limits on surveillance ads — but also evolved the lobbying tactic, by suggesting to Member States governments ways in which restrictions could be watered down in the final text to limit their impact on its ability to track and target web users.


As the report points out, Google’s fall back positions here are no accident — given that the tech giant has been working for several years to retool its tracking apparatus — under its so-called Privacy Sandbox plan — which proposes to switch from individual-level tracking and targeting to cohort or (now) topic-based targeting which will continue to subject web users to behavioral targeting just now putting them into buckets of eyeballs, not solo pairs.

So — to spell it out — if EU lawmakers were to limit the definition of behavioral advertising as Google suggests it could simply circumvent any limits on its flavor of behavioral advertising by saying it does not target individuals ergo the legal restriction simply doesn’t apply.

Similarly, a final text that would ban advertising to “known minors” would allow Google to claim it does not know the age of users who are not logged into its services (and potentially even users who are logged in as it does not explicitly age verify users) — again avoiding the need to restrict its behavioral targeting by default across most services (barring any it directly targets at children, such as YouTube kids).

Per the report, Google’s lobbyists didn’t stop there. They also sought to water down ad transparency requirements — pushing back against proposals that would allow users to know the criteria used to target them specifically, including when ads were targeted at kids and — in “detailed suggestions” to national governments — proposed that they should “seek to delete the obligation to disclose the criteria used for targeting, even when ads target vulnerable people like children”.

“The documents show Google taking a central position lobbying against limits to surveillance ads,” the report adds. “But they weren’t alone. Facebook, and other European companies [including Spotify] and publishers also resorted to trying to persuade national governments to oppose the Parliament’s position.”

Another big target for Big Tech tech lobbying was around data access for NGOs and public scrutiny…

Public scrutiny

On this issue, which is core to the DSA’s ability to deliver on the goal of ramping up accountability around major platforms, the report details particular moves by Spotify and Google to limit how much access external researchers can gain to platform data — such as to carry out research into the societal impact of recommender algorithms.

Civil society groups have been pushing to strengthen the Commission proposal in this area — to increase external scrutiny of VLOPs by forcing them to give access to data on algorithmic content ranking systems to vetted external researchers so they can study their function.

But Spotify and Google have been busy pushing back against closer scrutiny of how their AIs rank and recommend content to users, per the report.


“In March this year, Spotify followed up to add its comments ‘regarding the latest compromise proposals on Recommender Systems’. The company supported the ‘evolution of the text’ regarding recommender transparency and welcomed ‘a clarification in a Recital that these rules do not prejudice IP [intellectual property] rights and trade secrets’,” it adds.

Google, meanwhile, was lobbying Member State governments to limit data access for public authorities and vetted researchers to urgent health threats. So in this scenario Europeans might have to wait for the next pandemic to get external scrutiny of YouTube’s recommender engine!

Where the DSA will actually end up on this issue isn’t clear at the time of writing.

Google also questioned whether non-profits organizations should get data — seeking to spread fear that this could put “user data and privacy and confidentiality of information at risk”, according to lobbying documents obtained for the report.

“The company asked national governments to oppose the Parliament’s position and instead support the Council’s mandate. Taken all together, Google’s suggestions would make external scrutiny of the ways in which services like Youtube amplify or de-prioritise content nearly impossible,” it adds.

The report also reveals Google opposed proposals that would require platforms to “make the information on the main parameters for recommender systems and the functionality to opt-out from personalised recommendations directly accessible from the content itself” — presumably because that would make it too easy for users to figure out how to turn off unwanted content recommendations.

‘DMA? Er, just give us a chance to explain first…’

On the DMA, Google, Amazon, Apple and Facebook were all spotted in documents obtained for the report trying to soften the proposal during its last stage.


“The company’s main argument was that increasing data access, sideloading and interoperability would reduce user privacy and security,” the report notes, going on to conclude: “While Apple could not successfully stop interoperability and sideloading entirely, the final text does introduce a security safeguard, which will enable the company to try to justify not complying with these obligations.”

It also highlights one particular strand of collective lobbying by Big Tech targeting the DMA that looks intended to enable a repeat show of an oft used tactic against enforcement of existing EU laws which threaten how they like to operate — such as the GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). This tactic boils down to one word: Delay.

Per the report:

“[T]he top level message from the Big Tech companies to policy-makers regarding the DMA was the same across the board: Big Tech wanted to build a dialogue between the DMA’s regulator — the European Commission — and the companies covered by it — the gatekeepers, into the text and the regulatory approach. “They brought this wish up consistently at the high level meetings, such as the December meeting between Google and [Margrethe] Vestager’s cabinet. There Google said that regarding the DMA their ‘core argument towards the Parliament was the need for regulatory dialogue and the opportunity to individually justify certain practices’. Google repeated the same message to Breton’s cabinet in January — ‘Proper regulatory dialogue is important to ensure the enforcement of the DMA’. “On the very same day, Nick Clegg, Facebook’s head lobbyist, told Commissioner [Didier] Reynders, that for Facebook ‘it would be helpful to have the possibility of having a dialogue with regulators on questions concerning compliance’. “Amazon, in turn, told the Swedish government that it was ‘more comfortable with content of the Council compromise proposal than with the European Parliament’s amendments.’ The company also raised concerns that specific measures had been moved from Article 6 to Article 5, which would mean they would be automatically applicable and not dependent on a regulatory dialogue.”

Thing is, the whole point of the DMA is to bring in an ex ante competition regime for the bloc — via a set of ‘dos and don’ts’ that are supposed to apply up front for companies designated as gatekeepers, i.e. rather than antitrust authorities having to do the slow and painstaking work of building a case against a particular abusive behavior while the market suffers.

But there is — potentially — a sliver of wiggle room, at least for obligations set out in Article 6 of the DMA. For those requirements, the regulation allows for a dialogue between the Commission and relevant companies over how best to comply.

Which, well, sounds like it could be spun into delay heaven.



It’s not yet clear how successful the tech giants have been in this regard.

However the Commission has, in recent weeks, been spotted making some concerning noises on the topic of DMA enforcement to anyone who actually wants to see regulators crack down on Big Tech, as consumer protection experts have observed…

I cannot believe that the Commission talks so lightly about #DMA enforcement… it’s the Commission’s kitchen; it will take time to implement; we don’t have resources etc. Seriously people? Why on earth did the legislator (and everybody else behind) work so hard to get this law? — Agustin Reyna (@arcapde) March 31, 2022

“Ultimately the scope of regulatory dialogue in the DMA has been changed to allow the gatekeepers to initiate it. However, it will still be up to the Commission to decide whether or not to engage. We will have to wait and see how this plays out in practice,” is the report’s cautious conclusion on this.


The concern is that gatekeepers will continue to evade the GDPR’s purpose limitation principle by bundling consent for combining user data across multiple services into a single opt-in — thereby making it harder for users to deny — which is essentially how adtech giants like Facebook have evaded existing EU regulations, continuing to track and target web users in the region despite the GDPR’s requirement for unbundled consent (Facebook does not offer an opt out of behavioral advertising; to use its service you have to ‘agree’ to being profiled for ads).

Let’s make sure, ⁦@Andreas_Schwab⁩, 5(1)a #DMA closes the loophole for gatekeepers to combine data across all their many services and businesses whenever the user agrees to a single, all-embracing opt-in, undermining the very objectives of the DMA https://t.co/ZDDeEmb6K2 — Angela Mills Wade (@epc_angela) April 20, 2022

The parliament’s rapporteur on the DMA file, MEP Andreas Schwab, has rejected the concern in recent days — suggesting that the DMA does not change the GDPR. And indeed, in a letter responding to the ICCL which we’ve reviewed, that “the consent requirement under the DMA builds on the GDPR consent”. He has also claimed there’s “no need to fear circumvention” because the Commission will be in charge of enforcement. Aka, no more forum shopping.

However signatories to the letter continue to warn that gaps in GDPR enforcement create a problem for effectively enforcing the DMA — unless the Commission acts quickly to provide guidance and bring cases.

Collective concern is #GDPR is not enforced today. So indeed now falls on Commission to be very clear about how it will require #GDPR rules to be met in practice as part of #DMA compliance. There’s a major gap in enforcement to be filled, need guidance & cases soon @johnnyryan — Cristina Caffarra (@Caffar3Cristina) April 20, 2022

“Gatekeepers will try to use the ambiguity to their advantage,” warns the ICCL’s Johnny Ryan. “It is essential that the Commission issues quick and clear guidance and enforcement decisions to stop that.”

Structural weakness?


This means that there are, at least from one perspective, multiple point at which lobbyists can seek to influence — or indeed block — EU policymaking.

This starts with the Commission itself, as the EU’s executive body drafts and thus frames legislative proposals; moving on to MEPs who play a key role by voting for amendments and to set the parliament’s negotiating position (typically prefigured via committee vote/s); and extending to Member States’ governments which are represented on the Council and lead the so-called trilogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission to seek a compromise via a rotating presidency structure that sees one Member State (currently France) responsible for producing compromise texts on behalf of the Council.

So, in short, it’s a lobbyists’ picnic!

The latter stage trilogue negotiations are especially problematic, being conducted entirely behind closed doors — thereby reducing transparency on how exactly policy is being reshaped, as the report underlines:

“This process is one of the most secretive stages of EU policy-making, held entirely behind closed doors and with nearly no public access to the discussions. The EU Institutions have argued that this secrecy is needed in part to prevent lobbying pressure on the policy-makers. “New lobby documents obtained from the European Commission and the Swedish government via freedom of information requests show that intense corporate lobbying is happening regardless of the lack of transparency.”

The details that the civil society groups were able to glean on big tech’s lobbying around the DMA and DSA are only partial, as the report notes that responses to freedom of information requests varied.

However they say the documents they did obtain showed that tech giants like Google continued to target the trilogue process even after the Council had agreed its negotiating positions — meaning they are shown trying to grasp a very last minute, non-transparent opportunity to favorably water down measures that could shrink their market power.

“We can now confirm that corporate lobbying of EU capitals continues even after the Council agrees its positions and starts trilogue negotiations with the Parliament and Commission,” the report authors write. “While only Sweden gave us extensive access to these documents, we can expect that all EU governments must be on the receiving end of similar lobby efforts.”

“The lobby documents also reveal that Google remained in frequent contact with the Swedish government from January to the end of March (the time when we placed our freedom of information request). During this period, the tech giant would send in analysis of the difference positions, adding the company’s own analysis, and all the while replicating the EU Institutional format of documents with four columns,” they go on. “As the discussions went on behind closed doors, Google pitched in with ‘specific language on articles currently discussed’ and suggested ‘concrete amendments’, showing a strikingly live knowledge of what was happening in the negotiation process.”


The lobbying tactics they are reported to have used included:

pitting the EU Institutions against one another;

becoming more technical and offering amendments to the text;

using meetings to gain access to information that was not available to the public;

going high level: bringing in the CEOs to meet Commissioners, inviting them to off the record dinners.

Corporate Europe Observatory and Global Witness argue that this evidence of lobbying taking place during trilogues “shows how the lack of transparency benefits big corporate lobbies and adds weight to the urgency of finally opening the trilogues process up to the public” — further suggesting: “This secrecy means that only the well-resourced and well-connected lobbying actors can follow and intervene in trilogues, and excludes citizens from crucial discussions that will have an impact on their lives.”

“National governments have a say in EU policy-making via the Council. This is often referred to as the EU’s ‘black box’, as it is difficult for citizens to know who is lobbying their national government on EU policies, or even what position their national government takes in the Council. This approach, combined with the fact that lobbying at member state level requires massive resources and good connections, creates the conditions for undue corporate influence,” they add.

The report makes a series of recommendations to protect EU policymaking against undue influence by the most well-resourced lobbyists, based on the NGOs’ tracking and analysis of the DSA and DMA process since the drafting stages.

Its suggestions include shedding light into the trilogues by publishing an up-to-date calendar of meetings, including summary agendas, and proactively publishing the four-column document (which details co-legislator positions and amendments) on a rolling basis; boosting transparency and democratic accountability at the Member State and Council level including by requiring disclosure of each country’s position; putting limits on one-to-one lobby meetings and replacing them with public hearings as much as possible; and requiring EU institutions to proactively seek out those who have less resources, such as SMEs, independent academics, civil society and community groups.

Other recommendations include beefing up the existing EU Transparency Register to improve transparency on lobbying; putting in place proper funding transparency requirements that mandate think tanks and other organisations to reveal their funding sources; strengthening ethics rules to block the revolving door between EU institutions and Big Tech firms and establishing an independent ethics committee which can launch investigations and implement sanctions.

The report authors also urge EU officials and policymakers to be sceptical of those lobbying them — writing that they “should question their funding sources, check their information and data sources and denounce any type of wrongdoing or non-transparent/unethical lobbying they encounter”.

They also recommend they should not attend or participate in events or debates that are closed to the public, held under Chatham House rules, or that do not disclose their sponsorship.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/google-facebook-apple-eu-lobbying-report/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/GettyImages-1230444599.jpg?w=600,TechCrunch
"TechCrunch+ roundup: Churn rate basics, BNPL fraud, fundraising IP checklist – TechCrunch","The venture capital market is slowing down, which means early-stage founders are chasing a smaller pool of money.


In this environment, teams that successfully close a fundraising round will find themselves with a shorter runway than they planned on, which means partnering with an investor who understands the business well enough to add value is more critical than it was a year ago.

Because a founder’s pitch is the first step on that journey, we’re interviewing active investors to learn more about what they’re looking for and how they prefer to be approached.

For our latest outing, we asked each of them to name a pro forma pitch practice they think founders should retire. Notably, angel investor Marjorie Radlo-Zandi said entrepreneurs who embellish the size of their market are sabotaging themselves.

“Don’t be tempted to overstate your market size and its infinite potential,” she said. “We call blatantly inflated numbers ‘handwaving.’ If you exaggerate, you’ll appear less credible to investors. Not all investors expect to invest in the next unicorn.”

4 questions every CISO should be asking about the metaverse

The metaverse is still taking shape, but it’s already creating headaches for cybersecurity professionals.

Technology that places users inside virtual, immersive environments where they can transact could unlock untold benefits, but it will definitely create a threat attack surface of titanic proportions.

"Finally, we know why there’s a rubber chicken on Twitter – TechCrunch","The internet is full of mysteries. Who really wrote “My Immortal,” and was it supposed to be a satire? Who is behind the group of hackers known as Anonymous? And why can’t Elon Musk just log off?

But a new question arose about two and a half months ago, when writer and reverse engineer Steve Moser found some very silly images in the Twitter backend:

Among the 16 images that were unearthed, we’ve seen some of the tamer ones surface, like the bright green bird with speech bubbles. But these illustrations were so bizarre that they have been seared into my brain. A potato with a mouth talking to a potato with eyes? A broken eggshell giving a press conference? A calculator printing out a fried egg? Why so many eggs?

But perhaps the most mundanely strange illustration was just a floppy rubber chicken. We finally spotted our avian acquaintance in the wild, making us feel like this:

Starting today, Twitter users began reporting that if you search for something that yields no results, you see our fun little rubber chicken friend.

Here’s an example of how it looks:

More and more of these unhinged illustrations are bound to start popping up on the bird site, and personally, we can’t wait. For one, it looks like our egg-at-press-conference buddy is about to have his big moment, and we’re happy for him (don’t worry, weird potato twins, your time will come).",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/twitter-rubber-chicken/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/twicken-1.png?w=711,TechCrunch
A second Staten Island Amazon warehouse is holding a union vote on Monday – TechCrunch,"Emboldened by the recent results of the nearby JFK8 fulfillment center, workers at Staten Island’s LDJ5 sort center are set to hold their own vote this coming Monday, April 25th. Voting will continue through Friday the 29th, with vote counting set to begin on May 2 — almost exactly a month after April’s historic results.

Votes will be cast via secret ballot inside a tent, with monitoring by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB ). Following a 2,654 to 2,131 union victory in the JFK8 vote, Amazon openly accused the NLRB of putting its thumb on the scale. The company told TechCrunch,

“We’re disappointed with the outcome of the election in Staten Island because we believe having a direct relationship with the company is best for our employees. We’re evaluating our options, including filing objections based on the inappropriate and undue influence by the NLRB that we and others (including the National Retail Federation and U.S. Chamber of Commerce) witnessed in this election.”

Today also marks the deadline for filing an official complaint for that election, though the company tells TechCrunch it has nothing new to report on that front. Amazon has been extremely aggressive in its attempts to stomp out any labor organizing after years of reports around working conditions. The retail is no doubt wary of a domino effect similar to what Starbucks is currently experiencing. It’s clear, however, that a first excited labor organizers.

BeReal: Hype or hit? What to know about the Gen Z photo-sharing app climbing the charts – TechCrunch,"BeReal: Hype or hit? What to know about the Gen Z photo-sharing app climbing the charts

An app called BeReal, founded by former GoPro employee Alexis Barreyat along with Kévin Perreau, launched in December 2019 with its idea of asking users to post an unedited photo once per day after receiving a push notification. Upon receiving the alert, the user has up to 2 minutes to share what they’re up to and can see the photos their friends also posted.

The app is simple to use, capturing a selfie and front-facing photo simultaneously — an experience that recalls our fond memories of the long-lost photo app Frontback. (RIP).

The company explains this experience offers users a chance to show off who they really are.

The concept itself is not entirely novel. Besides Frontback’s use of dual cameras, a similar idea involving push notifications emerged amid a wave of apps trying to siphon users away from Instagram a few years ago.

An app called Minutiae, launched in 2017, helped pioneer the same concept BeReal is now capitalizing upon: alerts that instruct users to snap whatever it is they’re doing now. Minutiae co-founder Martin Adolfsson recently lamented to TechCrunch that BeReal “borrowed pretty heavily” from his idea while touting its authenticity, much to his distress.


Plus, while Minutiae would allow users to browse strangers’ photos from around the world BeReal more squarely aims itself at groups of real-life friends.


Poparazzi — an app that turned Instagram’s tagging feature into its entire premise — hyped itself to the top of the App Store using a series of growth hacks not too long ago. It has since seen its popularity fade and is now No. 87 in the Photo & Video category on the U.S. App Store.

Another app, Dispo, delayed the release of your digital snaps to give itself a nostalgic feel, but aimed itself at a generation that has never known what it’s like to wait for prints. It also didn’t become the next new Instagram and is now No. 143 in Photo & Video on the App Store.

BeReal, meanwhile, has been around for a couple of years. But app intelligence firm Apptopia noted earlier this month that 65% of its lifetime downloads occurred in 2022 and its monthly active users had grown 315% year-to-date. Today, the firm offered TechCrunch updated figures. It found that BeReal has seen 7.67 million downloads year-to-date, representing 74.5% of its lifetime installs. France (where the app is based) and the U.S. lead, with a 20.5% and 19.7% share of installs, respectively.

The firm attributes the growth to a combination of word-of-mouth, BeReal’s college ambassador program and newer features like WidgetMoji and RealMoji — the former which puts your friends into a Home Screen widget, and the latter which lets you react with stickers in iMessage conversations. However, this level of rapid growth typically implies marketing or ad spend, not just organic adoption, which would be a slower rise and less sharp of a jump.

BeReal would have the funds. The a16z and Accel-backed app raised $30 million in a Series A last year. It sure seems like it’s put some of that money to use.

And as it turns out, at least some of BeReal’s growth had been manufactured to make the app look as if it were a viral hit. College students at Brown’s student paper reported BeReal was paying them $30 per referral and $50 for an app download with a review. The students would receive the money via PayPal or Venmo, they said. Other student ambassadors organized events and doled out perks, like free boba, to recruit new users, said a report from Rice University’s student paper.

The current ambassador program is running from January through June 2022, per BeReal’s website. (BeReal declined to talk to TechCrunch, saying they “are not ready for medias [sic].”)

There is nothing really wrong with paid user acquisition — this is how the app ecosystem works, after all. Besides, some paid users become engaged and loyal. That’s the goal!

BeReal is so far finding success with this model: Apptopia says daily active users have reached 2.93 million as of the time of writing.

It also has a 4.8 rating across nearly 22,000 user reviews on the App Store and a 4.5 rating across nearly 15,000 reviews on Google Play. It’s the No. 4 Overall app in the U.S. App Store right now.

That said, it’s a bit frustrating to see apps engaged in buying installs and five-star reviews get written up so definitively as Gen Z’s new favorite toy, in articles describing the app’s growth as organic. There may very well be some word-of-mouth interest here, but that interest has been combined with good ol’ paid app installs.

In the early days of the App Store, there were more direct channels for this sort of cash-to-downloads funnel, until Apple cracked down on companies “buying” their growth. But that only led to more behind-the-scenes paid user acquisition efforts. Today, in addition to traditional channels — like online ads/social ads, billboards, TV, etc. — we see things like “viral” TikToks that were actually undisclosed influencer marketing deals. Or, as with BeReal, college ambassadors getting compensated to hype an app to a target demographic.

The latter may actually work if the hype puts the app in front of users who end up charmed by the experience and stay with it.

BeReal likely has a good bit of user acquisition fuel ahead of it. And since its gimmick involves turning on push notifications, it could retain loyal users over time. But it has a long way to go to prove that it can become a part of users’ everyday rotation — something that we won’t know until the paid acquisition efforts slow and the app is left to fend for itself in the competitive landscape.

Still, we gotta love BeReal’s download URL: it’s bere.al/downloadthedamnthing.

Can saving trees really turn bitcoin green? – TechCrunch,"Bitso, a Mexico City-based crypto exchange, is pledging to buy carbon offsets for every bitcoin transaction on its platform to compensate for the cryptocurrency’s environmental toll. It may sound great in theory, but the idea also deserves a heaping dose of skepticism, given the sketchy reputation carbon offset efforts have earned over the years.

Bitcoin’s thirst for power has grown many times over, recently topping the electricity usage of several countries, including Denmark and Chile, per Cambridge University estimates. Most of that energy (61%, according to Cambridge) comes from burning fossil fuels, and unfortunately Bitso can’t do anything to stop the resulting emissions from entering Earth’s atmosphere.

Well, it could, say, ban energy-intensive tokens altogether. But that won’t happen. Instead, Bitso is working with Moss.Earth, a São Paulo, Brazil-based carbon offsets company, to indirectly mitigate the emissions associated with transacting bitcoin and Ethereum-based tokens via its platform. The exchange plans to do so by buying tokenized “credits from conservation projects in the Amazon Forest in Brazil.”


For the numbers freaks: Bitso estimates each bitcoin transaction on its platform “generates 29.4kg of CO 2 emissions, equivalent to 0.0294 MCO2 tokens, which Bitso will purchase at market price,” a spokesperson told TechCrunch. There are a wide range of estimates that try to pin down the exact emissions tied to a single bitcoin transaction, and some are far greater than Moss and Bitso’s, but that’s beyond the scope of this story. As for MCO2: It’s an ERC20 token and has its own associated emissions, but Ethereum is more efficient than bitcoin and the platform is also working toward a less thirsty proof-of-stake system. Phew!

With more than 4 million users, Bitso calls itself the most popular and largest platform of its kind in Latin America. Yet globally, CoinMarketCap ranked Bitso in 67th place on its list of top exchanges at the time this story was published, reflecting the limited scope of the deal.

Moss wants more. “Our hope is that other projects within the space will follow suit to offset their carbon footprint,” Moss CEO Luis Felipe Adaime said in a statement.

So, will it work? Though the carbon credit industry is huge and expected to balloon in size in the coming years, such efforts get tons of flak for failing to live up to their perceived potential. Greenpeace, for example, writes that “carbon offsetting plans are essentially PR plans,” arguing that companies “need to stop carbon emissions from getting into the atmosphere in the first place.”

Lena Klaaßen, a Zürich-based PhD researcher in climate finance and policy, told TechCrunch over email that it’s “generally possible to offset emissions resulting from cryptocurrency-related activities,” but she cautioned that “transparency on the calculation methodology, data quality, and offset selection are key to evaluate the quality of such a project.”

For its part, Bitso calls this a “first step towards a larger sustainability strategy to address the environmental impacts of the crypto industry.” Moss projects the deal “will save around 342 thousand trees in the Amazon, offsetting approximately 5,283 tons of carbon dioxide.” In total, Moss says it has helped save “approximately 152 million trees in the Amazon through internationally certified and audited projects” since March 2020. The company claims to work with the “most reputable environmental projects,” and it offers some details on how they operate via its site. Still, trusting Moss requires some faith in Vera as well as carbon credits in general. And again, when it comes to carbon credits, skepticism abounds.

Saving and planting trees are both wildly popular ideas, but many environmental and advocacy groups have criticized politicians’ and corporations’ arboreal fixation, in part because they say there’s simply not enough room for all the dang saplings we’d need to mitigate the soaring emissions that come from harvesting and burning fuel.

Anyways, happy Earth Day!",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/can-saving-trees-really-turn-bitcoin-green/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/shutterstock_128451140.jpg?w=600,TechCrunch
Twitter is testing a ‘CC’ button that will let you turn video captions on or off – TechCrunch,"Twitter is testing a ‘CC’ button that will let you turn video captions on or off

Twitter announced today that it’s beginning to test a “CC” button that will let users turn video captions on or off. The feature is rolling out to some iOS users and will be coming to Android users soon, Twitter notes. A video posted by the social media shows that the CC button will appear in the top-right corner of a video that has captions available.



Twitter rolled out auto-generated captions on videos last December to make videos more accessible for deaf and hard-of-hearing users. Auto captions are available on web, iOS and Android in more than 30 languages, including English, Spanish, Japanese, Arabic, Thai, Chinese, Hindi and many more.

Today’s announcement comes as Twitter recently launched improved alt text accessibility features globally. Images with alt text will now contain an “ALT” badge in the corner of the image. When you hover over the badge, you’ll see the user-generated image description.

Twitter has been testing numerous features over the past few months. Most recently, the company has been spotted working on a feature that would allow users to set a status on their profiles and tweets. It appears that users would not only have the option to set a profile-level status, but also be able to set a status for a specific tweet. It’s currently unknown if users would only be able to select pre-set statuses or if they would have the option to create custom ones.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/twitter-testing-cc-button-video-captions/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/twitter-2021-10-a.jpg?w=711,TechCrunch
Lapsus$ hackers targeted T-Mobile source code in latest data breach – TechCrunch,"The Lapsus$ hacking group has claimed another victim: U.S. telecom giant T-Mobile.

T-Mobile’s latest security incident — the seventh data breach in the past four years — was first revealed by security journalist Brian Krebs, who obtained a week’s worth of private chat messages between the core members of Lapsus$, a hacking and extortion group that gained notoriety in recent months after targeting tech giants Nvidia, Ubisoft and Okta. The messages obtained by Krebs were sent in a private Telegram channel during the week leading up to the arrests of the gang’s most active members in March. At least two Lapsus$ members — a 16-year-old and a 17-year-old — were subsequently charged with multiple cyber offenses.

The messages show that Lapsus$ had access to T-Mobile’s network by compromising employee accounts, either by buying leaked credentials or through social engineering. This gave Lapsus$ access to T-Mobile’s internal tools, including Atlas, used for managing customer accounts, which the hackers used in an attempt to find T-Mobile accounts associated with the FBI and Department of Defense, but were blocked as the access needed additional checks.

Through this employee account access, the hackers were in a position to carry out SIM-swap attacks, where hackers reassign a target’s cell phone number to a device under their control, which then allows for the interception of phone calls and text messages that can be used to further break into a victim’s accounts and also obtain two-factor authentication codes.

T-Mobile did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but told news outlets that “no customer or government information” was accessed during the incident.

However, Krebs reports that the hackers were able to steal source code for a range of company projects — just as the group had done with Samsung, Microsoft and Globant.


T-Mobile has confirmed six other, previous data breaches since 2018. Last August, the telecom giant admitted that at least 47 million customers had account data stolen as a massive data breach. Hackers accessed personal data belonging to 7.8 million current postpaid customers, including dates of birth and Social Security, and also hackers accessed the records of 40 million former and prospective customers.",Carly Page,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/lapsus-hackers-t-mobile/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1219589688.jpg?w=600,TechCrunch
Twitter spotted testing a feature that would let users set status updates – TechCrunch,"Twitter has been spotted working on a feature that would allow users to set a status on their profiles and tweets. According to reverse engineer Jane Manchun Wong, who searches the code of mobile apps to spot features and upcoming changes in development, the social media giant is working on a “set a status” feature that is currently codenamed “vibe.” It appears that users would not only have the option to set a profile-level status, but also be able to set a status for a specific tweet.

It’s currently unknown if users would only be able to select pre-set statuses or if they would have the option to create custom ones. As noted by Wong, there may be issues related to spam if Twitter allows users to create custom statuses.


ℹ️ It should also be possible to add an emoji, perhaps it is something similar to the feeling/activity option of #Facebook posts 🤔 pic.twitter.com/xisc14WE3e — Alessandro Paluzzi (@alex193a) March 30, 2022

When asked about the test, a spokesperson from Twitter told TechCrunch that the company doesn’t have anything to share on it at the moment.

The status feature could be a way for people on Twitter to let others know that they’re currently busy, out of the office, at a specific conference and more. Some Twitter users currently use their display names to indicate specific things, such as being out of office or on vacation. The status feature could be a way to indicate this in a clearer and less-cluttered way.

This isn’t the first time that Twitter has said to be testing a status-like feature. In 2018, Twitter was exploring the idea of a “presence indicator” that was designed to help users describe what they were currently doing, but the concept was never actually tested widely.

It’s unknown when or if Twitter will move the idea of status updates beyond the testing phase. If the social media giant does plan to release the feature, there will be questions about how statuses will be moderated if Twitter lets users create custom statuses.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/twitter-testing-feature-set-status-updates/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/GettyImages-180572501.jpg?w=601,TechCrunch
"Instagram tests a Templates feature, which allows you to copy formats from other Reels – TechCrunch","Instagram is testing Templates, a new feature that will allow Reels creators to use the same format as other videos, according to Business Insider.

The feature is currently only available to a small group of creators and is in beta testing. It’s similar to TikTok’s Templates, which allows users to plug in their own photos into a preset format.

“We are always working on new ways to make Reels simpler to create. We are testing the ability for you to make a reel using an existing Template from another reel,” a Meta spokesperson told TechCrunch in an email.

Developer Alessandro Paluzzi saw an iteration of this feature in reverse-engineered versions of the app’s code in January, and influencer Josephine Hill tweeted about the feature in March.

“One thing that I’ve been looking for, particularly with Instagram Reels, was something that resembles TikTok’s audio sync where the clips line up perfectly to the beat of the music,” Hill told Business Insider. She added that previously she would turn to tutorials for help in editing videos, particularly when it came to lining up videos with sound, and that the slots for adding in your own clips vary for each template.

As other companies — including Facebook, YouTube and Snapchat — try to compete with TikTok using their own version of short-form video apps, it’s hard to challenge TikTok’s popularity. Creators often opt to upload TikToks to Reels, rather than create content in Instagram, but this may be a way to change that or at least to even out the competition. Reels has introduced features similar to TikTok’s in the past, like Remixes, which launched last year. Earlier this year, TikTok expanded the feature so that users could remix any publicly uploaded video, not just Reels.",,https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/22/instagram-tests-a-templates-feature-which-allows-you-to-copy-formats-from-other-reels/,https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/instagram-reels-india.jpg?w=593,TechCrunch

"David Simon, Jon Bernthal and the Makers of HBO’s ‘We Own This City’ on Dirty Cops, the Drug War and the Legacy of ‘The Wire’","David Simon may have left The Baltimore Sun’s crime desk more than 20 years ago, but he never lost his nose for a good story — nor his commitment to chronicling the ravages of the war on drugs in his hometown. His nonfiction books on the subject, Homicide and The Corner (the latter written with former BPD detective Ed Burns), both inspired eponymous TV series and would form the basis of HBO’s The Wire, which Simon created in collaboration with Burns. Simon oversaw five seasons of the critically revered show before going on to dramatize the wayward turns of the American experiment in other cities and time periods: post-Katrina New Orleans (Treme), Yonkers in the 1980s (Show Me a Hero), and New York City in the 1970s (The Deuce) and the 1940s (The Plot Against America) — each time for HBO.

After this grand tour of American dysfunction, Simon and George Pelecanos — a crime novelist who wrote several episodes of The Wire and co-created several series with Simon — have returned to Baltimore with their new miniseries, We Own This City, which premieres April 25. Based on the book of the same name by former Sun reporter Justin Fenton (one of Simon’s successors on the paper’s crime beat), the show addresses the high-profile scandal that rocked the BPD in 2017, when several plainclothes officers from the department’s elite Gun Trace Task Force unit were convicted of racketeering — among many other charges — for their abusive practices and their role in a conspiracy to distribute stolen drugs.

The group’s ringleader, Detective Wayne Jenkins, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. He is played in the series by Jon Bernthal, whose extensive research for the role included ride-alongs with active police and numerous conversations with Jenkins and his former colleagues. Bernthal reteams with his King Richard director Reinaldo Marcus Green, who helms all six episodes of We Own This City. Both former baseball players — Green considered a career in the MLB, and Bernthal played pro ball in Moscow while studying theater there in the early 2000s — the two shared a close bond on set. “We both talk about this work on almost purely athletic terms,” Bernthal says in a recent Zoom session with Green, Pelecanos and Simon. Green, as it happens, joined in from his car as he drove to a little league field in Mar Vista, “where I literally take half my meetings.”

(“You coming back from the bank or something?” joked Pelecanos, in reference to Green’s success with King Richard, for which Will Smith won the best actor Oscar.)

In the conversation that followed, the four men discussed the making of WOTC; what has changed in Baltimore and America in the 14 years since The Wire ended; and the tragic futility of the drug war.


David, you have spent much of your career covering the Baltimore streets. You were on the crime desk at the Sun; you wrote the books Homicide and then The Corner, both of which were turned into series; then made five seasons of The Wire. What made you think you weren’t finished with this story?

David Simon: This came about in a one-two punch. I read the stories contemporaneously that Justin Fenton was writing — he had my old gig at the Sun at the time — and I thought, “There’s a book in here. And so I actually called Justin and I hooked him up with my book agent. And I said, “We’ve reached a level of dystopia in the drug war that is fresh and this scandal, it has legs and it’s got to be written.” And so that’s all I was thinking about. I wasn’t thinking about television or dramatizing it. I was just thinking, journalistically, this needs to be a book. But after I hooked him up with my agent and they got a contract, I let it be. Lo and behold, about a year later, here comes George Pelecanos.

George Pelecanos: Kary Antholis, an executive at HBO, called me and said, “Read this manuscript and let me know what you think. Maybe you’d like to adapt it as a miniseries.” I thought there was a lot there to talk about. And then I said, “I’ll do it if I can bring in my partners, David Simon and Nina Noble, and a couple of The Wire writers as a karmic return to Baltimore.” And that’s how it came about.

One major development since the end of The Wire was the death of Freddie Gray at the hands of Baltimore police, and the unrest that followed — which you touch upon in the series. Did you feel like this would warrant a revisiting of the story as well?

Simon: A generation passed. We wrote the last words of The Wire 14 years ago. That’s a generation in the life of the police department when you consider that the average police career is about 20 years. Basically, the drug war that we argued against in The Wire continued apace to the point where generations of cops who had learned how not to do the job and how not to police properly were now colonels and majors. And they’re now teaching the next generation how not to do the job. So what Justin uncovered was basically a police department that had truly bottomed out. And that would’ve happened with or without Freddie Gray. What Freddie Gray and the aftermath of Freddie Gray delivered to Baltimore was a moment where, first of all, communities of color were saying, “We’ve had enough of being treated this way by our police department.” But secondly, the police department itself had a crisis of confidence in that they now had a few guys who knew how to police honestly or constitutionally who, in the wake of indictments related to the treatment of Freddie Gray, and in the wake of the public reaction, if they couldn’t work how they were taught, wouldn’t police. That meant that the guys who were willing to get out of their cars and police, even if they were doing it corruptly and for their own advantage, were now even more valued than before by the department.

In 2005, as the show makes clear, there were 100,000 arrests in Baltimore, a city of 600,000 people. And the conviction of half a dozen dirty cops in 2017 was just so extraordinary that I’m wondering whether you think of Baltimore as a representative example of the problems of the drug war in America or an outlier?

Reinaldo Marcus Green: I would say that Baltimore is a microcosm for many other cities in this country and around the world that face similar issues. I made my first feature film, Monsters and Men, in 2018 in the aftermath of Eric Garner. I only had 90 minutes to talk about it, but here we have six hours to really dive into a lot of the systemic issues that are facing our communities. I grew up in Staten Island, which is a lot of cops, a lot of firemen. And so a lot of the people that I grew up with are police officers. My father worked for the [New York City] Department of Investigation. And I think the conversations that I’ve been able to have in my life with the people that do wear the uniform, that wear it right, have given me an insight into both sides of the argument.

Did you ever have any run-ins with the law at that time?

Green: I’ve never been arrested, but yeah, I’ve always felt that my car stops were a little longer. My IDs were certainly checked a little bit more. I made a short film about Trayvon Martin, and it made me think: Look, I’ve got two master’s degrees, but at night with a hood on, I’m just another kid in the community. We’re all put in the same bucket. And that type of policing I think has become very problematic. I’ve been stopped for walking down my own street a number of times, and you can easily see how a situation can spin out of control, how talking back to an officer or just questioning your own rights could lead to an escalation. For every video you see, there’s a thousand interactions that you don’t. And that’s really the bigger issue.


Simon: I actually don’t think it’s about one guy. In fact, I think it would be an easier story to tell. The problem here is it’s not about the bad apples. It’s not even about a system; it’s about the mission. The entire mission of the drug war lends itself not only to the outcomes that Rei was just talking about, but it lends itself to the worst kinds of police work and to a destruction of the kind of police work that’s supposed to happen. We’ve accomplished nothing with the drug war. Drugs are as available as they’ve ever been. We haven’t done anything with the rates of addiction except watch them go up. It doesn’t achieve anything. But what it does do is fill prisons. It alienates. It’s destroyed the fourth amendment. It’s made the metrics of policing the things cops are rewarded for: guns and dope on the table, mass arrests. Meanwhile, the clearance rates, the arrest rates for murder, rape, robbery, assault — everything in my city has tanked, and Baltimore is as violent as it’s ever been in its modern history. That’s what the piece was about. Having said that, we kind of compelled Jon to be the poster child for all of that.


Jon Bernthal: I knew going in that, because of the resonance of The Wire and because of who David and George are and the access that they have in that city, we would be able to go in there and tell this unbelievably sensitive story. And I would be able to do it in the way that I wanted to do it in terms of prep. I would be able to go into the Baltimore Police Department and ask them for permission to let me enter into their lives, to go out on ride-alongs, to go to raids, to have these conversations with these folks who knew Wayne, when he’s probably the most vile and polarizing figure in the recent history of the department.

How did you find empathy for this character, which I assume you need to have in order to play him?

Bernthal: You always do, and you got to try to reserve judgment as best you can. In my first conversations with David and George, they said, “Look, the key here is we can’t just make this guy a monster.” But if you read the scripts, the dude’s a bit of a monster. That being said, we’re examining the culture of policing. When you’re celebrating quotas and putting drugs and guns on the table, you are creating a situation where corruption then has a blanket. He could do no wrong. For me, as far as empathy is concerned, I got to become very close with guys who were on Gun Trace Task Force. I got to know folks who coached youth football with Wayne. I got to talk to Wayne personally. Even getting to know Donnie Stepp, the drug dealer that Wayne sold drugs through. Every single person, to a person, said that Wayne was an unbelievably committed father, that there’s nothing in this world more important to him than his kids. It’s the first thing he and I talked about on the phone. Before anything else in this world, I’m a husband and I’m a father. And to me, there’s an enormous psychological disconnect: How can you be such a committed father yet engaged in such heinous activity that’s ultimately going to keep you away from your kids? That question was something that I could really hook into.

Jenkins was a particularly aggressive policeman. You’ve spoken openly about anger and violence in your past1 and how you’re reckoning with those issues. Did you draw on any of that history?

Bernthal: You always try to find points of connection. We’re telling a vital story. There’s no length that I felt that we wouldn’t go to. If that means connecting with something in my past … yeah, of course.

Pelecanos: Jon really went above the call of duty. We always offer our actors, “Hey, we’ll set you up with a ride-along or something like that.” But he dug deep himself. And there were times that he would come to set and I’d be like, “Hey Jon, why are you chewing gum or why do you have a lollipop in your mouth? And Jon’s like, ‘Oh yeah, Wayne Jenkins chewed gum,’ and knew the brand he chewed. (Laughs.) Very impressive.

How do you feel about the word “Method,” Jon? Has that been abused?

Bernthal: Absolutely. And that’s why these conversations are difficult for me, honestly, because every actor has a process. Having studied in Moscow at the Moscow Art Theater, I guarantee you that making everybody call you by your character name and not showering for eight months was not what Stanislavski had in mind with the Method. But at the end of the day, these sacred seconds between action and cut, that’s all we got. So that means that I got to stay in proximity to that role, close to those sacred seconds, that I’m not on a cellphone or eating Chinese food or making plans for the evening. But if I’m talking like Wayne and I’m acting like Wayne, because it’s going to help those seconds, I think you got to do that. And sometimes that’s a day, sometimes it’s a week, sometimes it’s five minutes. But I think this idea of Method acting where George was only allowed to call me Wayne, I don’t roll like that. I don’t see any benefit in that.

Did the Baltimore accent linger between takes, though?

Bernthal: Yes it did. But I think more importantly with Wayne, I think he was a code-switcher. If you look at it, he talks one way with Black folks and another with white folks. He talks differently on the streets than he does in command. Wayne used to take drug dealers’ phones and put his number in it. He would call his own phone with it and then he would call them later pretending to be a friend of theirs trying to speak in the same accent as that drug dealer spoke in. And he would hook up drug deals that way and arrest the guy. He would show off to his friends with how good he could rap and do hip-hop. He was constantly switching it up. It’s what made him so uncanny in his ability to manipulate people.


Simon: What Michael touched on there — which is always an amazing thing when an actor gets this personally involved — is the idea of the we of it. Why are we telling this story? So I had to have an honest conversation with him. I said, “I think the show you thought we were, we’re trying to be more than that. We’re trying to tell the story of the city and why American cities have reached this impasse: the death of work, automation and deindustrialization — a lot of forces are in play here that are fueling this drug culture that we showed in the first season, and we need to now demonstrate that.” He asked a question that deserved an answer. When George brought in [We Own this City] and said, “What do you think about dramatizing it?” that was a moment for us to say, “What does this piece say that The Wire didn’t get to?” The answer was basically, “The Wire said we were headed here. What does it feel like to finally arrive?”

Do you believe that a television show can change any of that?

Pelecanos: I’ll answer that. The answer is no. For me. Going back to The Wire, the thing that I’ve noticed occasionally is somebody will come up to me and say, “I became a teacher because of The Wire” or “I became a volunteer community activist.” I think that’s the best you can hope for, is pulling people through the keyhole occasionally. There’s a certain group of people on both sides of the spectrum — whether you’re a thin-blue-line person or you’re somebody who thinks that all police are bad — we’re not really trying to reach those people, because their minds are not going to change. We’re going for the people in the middle, who want to think about these things. So I don’t think we’re going to really change anything, but we can throw the issues up and make people think about it.

Most of your shows are deeply grounded in local reporting — including your own. Regional newsrooms are in decline across the country; do you have any faith in some of the digital startups working to shore that up?

Simon: Well, there’s something very specific in Baltimore right now. There’s something called The Baltimore Banner, which is an online newspaper that’s about to launch this year. They’re going to make about 50, 60 hires. In fact, Justin Fenton, the author of this book, has left the Baltimore Sun, which was being devoured by Alden2, destroyed by out-of-town ownership. He’s moved over to the Banner on the premise that the new publication — as a nonprofit, locally based newsroom — has to be the future. It can work if we can get a subscription base going on. I’m fully in support of it.

Another thing that’s changed since your earliest collaborations, George and David, is the discussion around who gets to tell what stories. But did those conversations affect the way you staffed We Own This City?

Simon: I think we always did a much better job of bringing in people of color on the directing side. You can be a bit of a critic for how The Wire came to be. At the time we started The Wire, there were not the same discussions of inclusion that there are now. Those discussions are obviously for the better. The Wire was what it was, and in some ways, [We Own This City] is a coda on that. We brought in [author] D. Watkins, one of the finer new voices in Baltimore, a guy who was badly policed as just a regular guy in East Baltimore by some of these very cops. He took a kick from Daniel Hersl3 to his ribs one day on the basketball court. So we tried to get a fresh voice. When George and I did The Deuce, the story came to us. We said, “You know what? I happen to be a guy. You happen to be a guy. We are not telling a story about pornography and sexual commodification and misogyny from a guy’s point of view. We need that writers room to be half women.” That change in the industry is absolutely healthy, and if you’re asking me if The Wire were to start up right now, would inclusion not be more of a priority, of course it would be, and rightly so.

You gave Justin Fenton, the author of the book, a walk-on part as himself. Having local characters play themselves is something you and George did a lot in Treme. It can add local cred, but does working with non-actors ever backfire?


Pelecanos: We had Rei in the show, too. He was a prison guard. I thought he was a little too handsome to be a prison guard.

Green: Yeah, I did steal the last scene of the show, guys. I’m sorry. I took the focus off of Jon.

Rei, given your work on King Richard, I have to ask: What was your reaction when you saw Will Smith slap Chris Rock at the Oscars? He later apologized to, among others, the people behind the film: Did you feel it was sufficient? (Silence.) Oh, looks like you’re muted.

Bernthal: He might stay muted. (Laughs.)


You’ve been quoted as saying that one of the people whose careers you’ve wanted to emulate is Cary Fukunaga. So far, so good: You’ve been a Sundance breakout, made a major feature film, now a prestige HBO show. Are you eager to direct a Bond movie?


Simon: I was just going to say that I think the focus should and can remain on the work until maybe the premiere party, where I plan on slapping Dom Lombardozzi5 for no particular reason. (Laughter.)

David, I’m curious, what can you tell us about your upcoming project set in Dallas, which you tweeted about recently?

Simon: It’s not greenlit. You probably shouldn’t talk about anything that’s not greenlit, but there’s a story about a Muslim FBI agent, and what happened to him is rather traumatic. This would have been after the first World Trade Center bombing, and then during the post-9/11 period. So I’m working on scripts about that true story, as a miniseries. He was posted in Dallas-Fort Worth as an FBI agent. So I’m going to need a city that looks like Dallas-Fort Worth in a state where I can take my cast and crew, where their reproductive rights will be held sacrosanct. Because as an employer, I can’t expose people who work for me to a situation in which their civil rights are impaired. So, If anyone knows that city and that state, give a yell.

Alexander Skarsgard and Nicole Kidman in Robert Eggers’ ‘The Northman’: Film Review,"It’s been a while since we’ve had an all-out blood-and-guts battle orgy in which warriors outfitted in sackcloth and animal skins hurl themselves into the fray, wielding swords and blazing torches, shields, hatchets and daggers, while bellowing dialogue that mostly begins and ends with “RAAARRRGGGHHH!” There’s a lot of that in The Northman, a brawny fever dream which makes the freaky artisanal horror that put director Robert Eggers on the map — The Witch and The Lighthouse — look like Disney movies. To use a term from a ritualistic fireside chant where Alexander Skarsgård’s Amleth blurs the line between man and beast, this is the untamed “berserker” of Norse legends.


The Northman The Bottom Line Ferociously elemental, energized and unhinged. Release date: Friday, April 22

Cast: Alexander Skarsgård, Nicole Kidman, Claes Bang, Anya Taylor-Joy, Ethan Hawke, Willem Dafoe, Björk

Director: Robert Eggers

Screenwriters: Sjón, Robert Eggers Rated R, 2 hours 18 minutes


But The Northman’s marauding energy holds you hostage and Prince Amleth is the hunky, heroically vengeful killing machine with a heart that Skarsgård was born to play. Longtime fans will get a kick out of him tapping into the cultural roots of his ancient True Blood vampire, Eric Northman, too.

The screenplay draws from both Norse myths and Icelandic family sagas, building on the Scandinavian legend of Amleth that inspired Shakespeare’s Hamlet. The prologue takes place in the fictitious North Atlantic island kingdom of Hrafnsey, where King Aurvandil (Hawke), aka War-Raven, arrives home to much fanfare. The gash in his guts inflicted by a foe in battle prompts him to prepare the 10-year-old Amleth (Oscar Novak) to take over the throne, despite the objections of Queen Gudrún (Kidman) that their son is just a boy. Amleth’s transcendental initiation involves crawling around on all fours underground with his father, howling like wolves. Also, belching, farting, levitating and accessing disturbing visions via Aurvandil’s wound.

No sooner has Amleth sworn to avenge his father should he die by an enemy’s sword than the boy witnesses his murder at the hands of his uncle Fjölnir (Claes Bang), whose friskiness with the Queen has already been joked about by the shamanistic court fool, Heimir (Willem Dafoe).

“Bring me the boy’s head,” Fjölnir commands his men, accompanied by the shrieking strings and pounding drums of Robin Carolan and Sebastian Gainsborough’s hard-driving score. But Amleth, after watching the slaughter of male villagers, abduction of the women and the Queen slung over Fjölnir’s shoulder and hauled off screaming, escapes by boat. He vows to rescue his mother, kill his uncle and avenge his father.

A couple decades later, Amleth has transformed into a muscle-bound man harnessing the spirit of both a wolf and a bear. He’s rage personified, traveling the Land of the Rus with a pack of Viking raiders that seemingly never met a Slavic settlement they couldn’t plunder. But Björk’s earth-mother seeress recognizes him as the lost prince and reminds him of his fate. Learning that Fjölnir was driven from the kingdom he usurped and fled to a remote agrarian community in Iceland, Amleth boards a slave ship headed there to supply labor.

Anya Taylor-Joy plays a fellow passenger who knows a good hook-up when she sees one. “I am Olga of the Birch Forest,” she says by way of introduction, adding that while he has the strength to break men’s bones, she has the cunning to break their minds. Both get taken on at Fjölnir’s farm, where Olga gradually gains Amleth’s trust and he reveals his plan to murder his uncle and save his mother, whom he believes is only feigning love for her abductor for the sake of their young son (Elliott Rose).


The storytelling accelerates as Amleth gets closer to his goal, wreaking carnage among his uncle’s men and sparking fear of a “distempered spirit” in their midst. The plotting becomes more frenetic though remains lucid, even if there are one or two arch moments that had me almost howling like a wolf.

Gudrún’s reunion with the son she long believed to be dead should have been a moment of high drama. But it’s hard not to laugh when Kidman, wearing Daryl Hannah’s old crimped hair from Splash and sporting a Natasha Fatale accent, greets a mighty silver blade at her throat with, “Your sword is long,” before engaging in some incestuous flirtation. When Fjölnir suffers a grievous loss and screams, “What evil is this?!” Gudrún shoots him a wide-eyed death stare and snaps, “Behave!” like she’s a Nordic Austin Powers.

The romance between Amleth and Olga also has time to blossom during all this, complete with a post-coital respite in the woods right out of John Boorman’s Excalibur. There’s also an interlude on a flying horse ridden by a fiery-eyed Valkyrie (Ineta Sliuzaite). But even as Amleth ensures the continuation of his bloodline, his deathly appointment with uncle Fjölnir at “the gates of hell” remains.


The film is shot by Eggers’ regular DP Jarin Blaschke, with restless propulsion and with a textured feel for the dramatic landscapes, lashed by rain, wind, snow and ice, or coated with mud and ash. The choreography of the combat scenes — both the staging and the shooting, in long, unbroken takes — is mind-blowing. Also fully enveloping is the dense sound design, with Viking Age instruments like the birch horn and bone flute heard alongside the thundering elements and the chaos of fighting.


Skarsgård, who has been working for more than a decade to develop a film project rooted in his childhood love of Viking myth and lore, has never been fiercer or more physically imposing. Taylor-Joy, who got her start in The Witch, is beguiling as Olga weaves baskets and plots havoc. (Her parents from that earlier film, Kate Dickie and Ralph Ineson, also make appearances.) Kidman is a hoot, juggling fire and ice in an enjoyably over-the-top turn. And if someone doesn’t cast Bang as a Bond nemesis or some other suitably elevated evildoer soon, then Hollywood just isn’t paying attention.

Whether you buy into Eggers’ insane epic, get high on its blood-drenched sorcery or roll your eyes at its excesses, the film makes you appreciate how seldom we get to see a big, noisy, brawling spectacle these days that’s grounded not in comic-book superheroes and villains but in culturally specific history. In other words, a work of bold imagination, not another offshoot of a familiar IP. That alone deserves respect.",David Rooney,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-reviews/the-northman-alexander-skarsgard-nicole-kidman-robert-eggers-1235127058/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Northman-Alexander-Skarsgard-Still-1-Publicity-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
‘Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness’ Banned in Saudi Arabia (Exclusive),"Disney and the MCU have fallen foul of Gulf censors once more.


While the film is yet to be released and also hasn’t yet been reviewed, the decision is once again said to be related to LGBTQ issues, according to Middle East sources, with the new sequel introducing the character America Chavez (played by Xochitl Gomez) who, as per her portrayal in the comics, is gay. With homosexuality officially illegal across the Gulf, films that feature any LGBTQ references or issues often fail to get past censors.

Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness was due to be released across the Gulf on May 5 as part of its global rollout. While advanced tickets are no longer available on the websites of cinemas in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar, they are in the United Arab Emirates, suggesting it will be released there.

The film follows on the heels of Chloé Zhao’s Eternals, which was banned across much of the Gulf in November following the inclusion of a same-gender couple in the film and the MCU’s first gay superhero. At the time, THR understood that censors had requested a series of edits to be made that Disney was not willing to make. An edited version did screen in the U.A.E., however.

In January, West Side Story was also stopped from hitting cinemas in Saudi Arabia, the U.A.E., Qatar, Bahrain, Oman and Kuwait. This time, regional sources told THR the decision was due to the character Anybodys, written as transgender in the new adaptation and played by nonbinary actress Iris Menas.",Alex Ritman,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/doctor-strange-multiverse-madness-movie-saudi-arabia-ban-1235133898/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/SRV-16866_R-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"Theater Owners Chief on the Box Office Recovery, the (Waning) Relevance of the Oscars and a Jam-Packed Summer Slate","This year’s CinemaCon comes at a critical juncture for the beleaguered box office. All five major Hollywood studios will show up in Las Vegas, beginning April 25, to lay their cards on the table and tout their 2022 slates to theater owners still trying to emerge from the pandemic while battling changing consumer habits.

Expect teasers and footage for Avatar 2 (yes, it’s really happening), Jurassic World Dominion, Black Adam, The Flash and much more. Family highlights will include Toy Story spinoff Lightyear and Minions: The Rise of Gru. Other 2022 titles sure to be mentioned are the next installments in the Doctor Strange, Black Panther and Thor franchises, while Paramount is treating exhibitors to a full screening of Tom Cruise’s Top Gun: Maverick.

In the aftermath of Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, it sort of got lost that Apple TV+ became the first streamer in history to claim the best picture prize. Did you wince when CODA, a film that had only a token release in cinemas, won for best picture?

CODA is a gorgeous film. But we all are concerned about the continuing relevance of the Oscars, because the ceremony used to be something really important for theatergoers around the world. Some of the movies that used to be in the mix had a very significant theatrical box office, like Titanic. It’s different now. Spider-Man: No Way Home didn’t even get nominated [for best picture] despite its commercial and artistic success. It’s Sony’s biggest film of all time. What about No Time to Die? It was a pretty important Bond movie. It’s about whether Academy voters have lost touch with what movie fans like. The Oscars show has become less and less relevant. It’s unfortunate.

Apple rereleased CODA in cinemas after its Oscar but didn’t report grosses. Thoughts?

A lot of streamers do that. It’s not about streamer versus nonstreamer. We are still in the middle of a streaming war. Companies that are trying to build their streaming services are still making bad business decisions just to get subscribers in order to win the streaming horse race. That’s not a long-term business philosophy — that’s a short-term fight. There’s no doubt that a movie released exclusively in theaters and then later on whatever streaming service fares better.

For years, any hint of shortening the traditional three-month theatrical window would prompt threats of a boycott. Coming out of the pandemic, the window is as short as 17 to 45 days.

NATO doesn’t set policy; that’s negotiated individually by our companies. But we’re very happy with where things are looking. The pre-pandemic window was pretty outdated and had been around for a very long time. This new model will make it easier to get midsize- and smaller-budget movies released theatrically. There’s a dynamite list of blockbusters, but amidst those, I’m looking forward to Babylon from Damien Chazelle and Steven Spielberg’s semiautobiography The Fabelmans and Tom Hanks’ A Man Called Otto and Olivia Wilde’s Don’t Worry Darling. Will there be the individual struggles? Yes. Will there be movies that we think are being released with a window that’s too short? Yes. But the overall trends are very good.

Ellis Jacob, the longtime CEO of Cineplex Entertainment — Canada’s largest theater chain — is known for his even-keeled, levelheaded style. On April 26, he’ll be feted with CinemaCon’s top honors when receiving NATO’s 2022 Marquee Award. When COVID-19 struck, Jacob was chairman of NATO’s board. John Fithian says Jacob provided steady leadership as the industry descended “into the depths of the pandemic” and praises him for pairing that stewardship with “a kindness and courtesy that is rare and is a hallmark of his career.” Other top honorees include Focus Features, which is celebrating its 20th anniversary this year. The Universal-owned specialty label has amassed more than 140 Academy Award nominations, including 14 best picture nods (Kenneth Branagh’s Belfast is the most recent example); it’s won 26 Oscars overall. Other CinemaCon honorees this year include Disney’s Jeffrey Forman (Passepartout Award), Renana Teperberg (global achievement in exhibition award) and Constantin Films’ Martin Moszkowicz (career achievement award).

Jason Bateman Teases the ‘Ozark’ Series Finale: “A Happy Ending But They’re Limping”,"Things might not be all bad for the Byrde family when Ozark drops its final batch of episodes later this month.

Series star Jason Bateman dropped by The Tonight Show on Friday, where he and host Jimmy Fallon discussed what’s in store for fans of the Emmy-winning Netflix drama that focuses on money launderers Marty Byrde (Bateman) and wife Wendy (Laura Linney), along with their partner Ruth (Julia Garner). After the first seven episodes of the fourth and final season were released Jan. 21, the remaining seven episodes will be available to stream April 29.

When Fallon asked if there’s any chance that the dark narrative could have a happy ending, Bateman explained that he and showrunner Chris Mundy would chat ahead of each season to discuss the general themes, along with where the story might be heading.

“With the final season, the whole thing was like, ‘Well, how are we gonna end it?’ Should the Byrde family pay a bill, you know? Like, should they get away with it? Should they not?” Bateman recalled. “And so he said, ‘I want it to be a happy ending, but there’s got to be a little of a, Well, is it happy for them?'”

The star mentioned that the show’s team didn’t initially know how things would end when the series first launched in July of 2017. He continued about the finale, “Hopefully the audience will think, ‘Ah, they’ve kind of threaded the needle between a happy ending — but they’re limping.'”

During an interview earlier this year with The Hollywood Reporter, Mundy said he wanted viewers to get closure and added, “Hopefully, the back half will still be fun and exciting, but also really emotional for the Byrdes and Ruth.”",Ryan Gajewski,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jason-bateman-ozark-series-finale-happy-ending-1235134348/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/TCDOZAR_ZX081-copy-1612385839.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
Kris Jenner Says Blac Chyna Tried to Murder Rob Kardashian in 2016,"Kris Jenner became emotional while recalling a volatile 2016 argument she heard about between her son Rob Kardashian and his then-girlfriend Blac Chyna that traumatized him.

Jenner testified for the second day from the witness stand in a Los Angeles courtroom on Friday that she believed Chyna attempted to murder her son. At the time, she said she was told that Chyna pointed a gun at Kardashian’s head, tried to strangle him with a phone cord and hit him with a metal pole while intoxicated.

“It was complete chaos. It was scary,” said Jenner, the 66-year-old Keeping Up with the Kardashians matriarch. She’s the first of four defendants — a group that also includes her daughters Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner — to testify in Blac Chyna’s $100 million lawsuit alleging the women conspired to have her reality show Rob & Chyna canceled and damage her celebrity status.

Earlier this week, much of Chyna’s testimony dealt with the fight, and the celebration of the show’s renewal the night before. Chyna testified that she was joking with her fiancé when she wrapped a phone cord around his neck and grabbed his unloaded gun off a nightstand.

But Kris Jenner said putting a gun to her son’s head was “not a joke.”

“He was a mess,” she recalled while talking to her son after the incident on Dec. 15, 2016. “I could only imagine how he felt. … This was a horrible situation. I was heartbroken.”

Kris Jenner began to shed tears while remembering the Rob Kardashian-Chyna spat, which happened months after Kim Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. She said knowing that both her children had a gun pointed at them within the same year was traumatizing for her.

“While Rob’s situation was going on, Kim had just been dealing with Paris,” she said. “He had a gun put at his head, and she was held at gunpoint and thrown into a bathtub. That’s a lot to take as a mother.”

While on stand, Kris Jenner said her boyfriend Corey Gamble separated her son and Chyna — who she says smashed an expensive television in the master bedroom. But after Gamble pulled them apart and asked Rob Kardashian to leave, she was told that Chyna smashed a chair on the windshield of her son’s car.

In her questioning, Chyna’s lawyer, Lynne Ciani, asked why Jenner or anyone else did not call the police. Jenner said her security team — former Los Angeles Police Department officers — helped defuse the intense ordeal.

Kris Jenner claims she wanted to help Chyna. She said arguments between the couple were an “ongoing theme” in their relationship that included alcoholic beverages and drugs.

“We didn’t put Chyna on the show and give her this fabulous life to be taken away,” she said. “We created other opportunities. I was hopeful that it would be OK. That’s why I didn’t call [the police].”

Ciani tried to gain clarity about a text message sent from Kris Jenner to Rob & Chyna showrunner that read Chyna “beat the [expletive] out of Rob’s face.” She said the phrase was used as a figure of speech.

Kris Jenner compared her reference to Will Smith slapping Chris Rock during the recent Oscars.

“It’s like you’re at an awards show, and you get slapped,” she said while drawing some laughter from jurors and some others in the courtroom while her daughters’ facial expressions remained stoic.

Ciani asked about another text she sent to the showrunner that read “We need to ditch this [expletive]” after her son’s altercation with the Chyna. Jenner said she was very angry and upset at the time, but she claims she never had any involvement in hampering Chyna’s time on the show.

“It’s not my proudest moment, but it was how I felt at the time,” she said.

Chyna’s lawsuit, filed in 2017, alleges defamation and interference with contracts. It accuses Kris Jenner of being a ringleader who used her daughters in a campaign to defame Chyna as abusive to Rob Kardashian.

Kris Jenner would be an executive producer on the couple’s Keeping Up with the Kardashians spinoff, Rob & Chyna, which premiered on the E! Network later in September of 2016. She said she had nothing to do with the network deciding to not pick up the reality show for a second season.

With Kris Jenner being her son’s manager, she said she would receive a letter saying the show was “green lit.” But she says they never got a letter exercising the option.

Viola Davis Discusses “Shame” Around Hygiene in Childhood and the Teacher Who Made Her Feel Seen,"Viola Davis celebrated a teacher who was the “face of compassion and empathy” in her youth, a time when the actress felt shame and was shamed by others due to her family’s lack of resources.


Davis’ hygiene also became a painful source for understanding her own circumstances, she told Oprah Winfrey, including one day that she and her sister, Deloris, were called to the school office due to their “smell,” something she “didn’t know what to do about.”

“I think that people just automatically assume you just clean yourself. Well, not if anyone doesn’t show you,” she explained. “A lot of times we didn’t have any soap. A lot of times we didn’t even have any clean clothes.”

The actress went on to explain that her family hand-washed their clothing, but that would mean they either had to hang them outside — where icicles might build on them due to the cold — or inside, where they wouldn’t always fully dry.

“The next day if they’re not dry, they’re wet, but then if you’re not clean, you’re putting on wet clothes,” Davis recalled. “People don’t realize that if no one shows you, you have to figure it out on your own, and I didn’t have the tools to figure it out on my own. Then I was ashamed that I didn’t have the tools to figure it out on my own. All I had, all I could do, was swim in the shame.”


“She had tears in her eyes, and she was touching our faces, and she said, ‘I’m so sorry, Mrs. Davis. I’m so, so sorry. You let us know whatever we can do for you,'” the First Lady star recounted.

That support came in the form of calling Davis to the office and giving her a “bag full of the most beautiful clothes that were hand-me-downs from her daughter” — an act of generosity, the actress said, was like giving her “jewels.”

“When you are in the face of compassion and empathy, it’s amazing how it kills shame,” Davis said. “Because you’re seen, and you’re seen for something way more valuable than your circumstances.”

The special features Davis candidly discussing other elements of her childhood that she broaches in her memoir Finding Me, including growing up with an abusive alcoholic father as well as sexual abuse in her home. Speaking to the latter, the SAG and Tony winner touched on the historical culture around girls being casually sexualized, enduring harassment and even abuse.

“You know, it’s just not that dirty old man on the street who wanted to give you a quarter, but then wanted a kiss. No one knows what boundaries are with little girls, especially back in the day,” Davis said. “So if a guy said, ‘Give me a kiss,’ someone said, ‘Oh, give him a kiss. It’s not a big deal.’ Or someone leaves you with a male babysitter because that male babysitter is a friend of the family, and then your parents go out, and they leave you alone.”

Davis added, “They don’t think anything of it. We didn’t have social media back in the day where people would talk about statistics of how many girls are molested.”

Earlier in their discussion, Davis opened up about why she chose to talk about these issues and more in the memoir, as well as what prompted her decision to write the book. It was a choice that was “exacerbated” by the pandemic but grounded in her “hitting the top” in Hollywood. That was a time she felt like she’d know the meaning of her life. Instead, she had feelings of exhaustion, of imposters coming into her life when it came to friendships, people overstepping their boundaries and people feeling like she was a commodity.

“All I knew was that it wasn’t it,” she recalled of her trajectory. “So the question is, ‘Viola, what is it?’ What’s home to you, and how do you get at it? I didn’t know the answer to that. The only thing I could think to do was to go back to the beginning of my story because I think that once you tell your story over and over again, you start to hear it and you start to think, ‘OK, how did I get here?'”",Abbey White,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/viola-davis-oprah-winfrey-netflix-special-event-1235134196/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1184046935.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
‘Solar Opposites’ Production Workers Vote to Join Animation Guild,"Production workers on the animated alien sitcom Solar Opposites have voted to join The Animation Guild in a National Labor Relations Board election.

The eight-member bargaining unit unanimously voted to join the Guild (IATSE Local 839), the union says. (The Hollywood Reporter has reached out to the show’s distributor, Hulu, for comment.)

The vote count took place on Wednesday, after a voting period between April 1 and April 18. The Animation Guild first announced the news on Twitter on Thursday. “We did it!!!” tweeted Solar Opposites production coordinator Dana Bell, who added, “Huge thank you to everyone for all the support especially all the artists on RAM [Rick and Morty] and Solar who always had our backs, our shop stewards @teddyoconnor and Elisa, our organizer, and everybody who showed support!! Very proud of this moment.”


The election results represent the latest victory for the Guild when it comes to organizing production workers in animation. Last month, following a card count, a union for production workers at Titmouse L.A. was voluntarily recognized; the union says that a card count also recently yielded a voluntary recognition at Rick and Morty (distributor Adult Swim declined comment). While The Animation Guild has in the past represented production workers, when contracts at Titmouse L.A., Rick and Morty and Solar Opposites are negotiated “it will be the first time in recent history” that the Guild will cover such workers, says one Guild representative. At a recent Animation Guild rally, Guild organizer and field representative Ben Speight said the Local is intent on further organizing production workers on animated projects.

Meanwhile, the Guild remains tied up in protracted negotiations with the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers (AMPTP), which bargains on behalf of the major studios, over a new master agreement. Those negotiations began in late November 2021 and, as talks have stretched on, Guild members have become increasingly outspoken on social media about grievances like low compensation for animation writers covered under their agreement, color designers and story artists, among other issues.",Katie Kilkenny,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/solar-opposites-production-workers-vote-join-animation-guild-1235134050/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/solar_opposites_e206_0002-H-2021.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"Tony Awards Extend Eligibility Window, Delay Nominations Announcement","The 2022 Tony Award nominations announcement has been delayed by nearly a week, the show’s producers announced on Friday.

The nominations announcement has moved from May 3 to May 9. The shift has also extended the eligibility window for shows that opened during the 2021-2022 season from April 28 to May 4.

“Due to the challenges that Broadway has faced in recent weeks, and in an effort to allow nominators to see Tony eligible shows, we have decided to extend the deadline for eligibility requirements,” Charlotte St. Martin, president of The Broadway League and Heather Hitchens, president and CEO of the American Theatre Wing, said in a joint statement.

The nominations announcement will still take place on the Tony Awards’ official YouTube page, beginning at 9 a.m. ET / 6 a.m. PT.

In the last month, Broadway has faced a number of show cancellations due to breakthrough COVID-19 cases among various companies and their big-name stars. High-profile Broadway performers who have tested positive for COVID-19 as of late include Macbeth‘s Daniel Craig and The Plaza Suite‘s Sarah Jessica Parker and Matthew Broderick.

Presented by the Broadway League and American Theatre Wing, the 2022 Tonys announced in March that it would return to an in-person ceremony at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, after canceling the show in 2020 due to the pandemic and presenting a smaller in-person ceremony at the Winter Garden Theatre last September.

The 75th annual awards will air live coast-to-coast for the first time, with the four-hour presentation split between streaming service Paramount+ and CBS. The first hour, at 7 p.m. ET/ 4 p.m. PT will feature exclusive content streaming only on Paramount+. The awards show will continue at 8 p.m. ET / 5 p.m. PT live on CBS and streaming live and on demand on Paramount+.",Abbey White,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/arts/tony-awards-delay-2022-nominations-eligibility-window-1235134139/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Tony_Statuette_062510-5-H-2021.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
STX Sold to Investor Group Led by Najafi Companies,"STX Entertainment, the Robert Simonds-founded film and TV studio that once hoped to compete with Hollywood majors by focusing on mid-budget, talent-driven projects, has found another buyer in an investor consortium led by Najafi Companies. Investment firms AS Birch Grove LP and 777 Partners joined in financing the deal, which was unveiled Friday.

STX’s leadership team is staying in place as Simonds will serve chairman, Noah Fogelson is taking on the CEO role and Adam Fogelson will keep leading the motion picture group. “The closing of this deal signifies STX’s position of leadership and its hopeful future within the film and television industry,” stated Simonds. “We are excited to work alongside this highly respected investment company and are thankful for their continued support as we expand our library of star-driven content.”

The Phoenix-based Najafi-led group picked up STX assets after bidding $173 million for the company in December, although after the agreement was announced Lionsgate was also said to be exploring an offer for STX in a deal that didn’t materialize. The Najafi deal price tag was around $157 million with Eros keeping a 15 percent stake, a knowledgable source tells The Hollywood Reporter.

The plan for STX’s next chapter is to release four to five theatrical releases a year in the $20 million to $60 million range, this source says, along with plotting out premium video on-demand releases and selling projects directly to streaming companies. (Michael Mann’s upcoming Ferrari biopic, budgeted at $80 million, is said to be an exception for the studio.) A sequel to Greenland, which had been sent into bankruptcy protection amid sale uncertainty, is also expected to be a part of the studio’s slate.

“At a time when the demand for global content has never been greater, we are very excited about this rare opportunity to acquire STX Entertainment, one of the only remaining independent studios. As investors, we are long-term minded, and we believe in the power of storytelling and fostering a studio that is friendly to storytellers,” said Jahm Najafi, founder and CEO of The Najafi Companies.

Additional leadership unveiled Friday includes Andrew Warren continuing as CFO and London-based John Friedberg as leader of the film international and acquisitions divisions. STX, which currently staffs about 85 people in Burbank and London, recently underwent a round of layoffs in theatrical and distribution.


In kicking off its slate in January 2015, Adam Fogelson, formerly of Universal, described the company as “the first major studio to launch in two decades.” In the months after, the firm — which had initial backers that included private equity firm TPG Growth and China-based Hony Capital — closed a multiyear financing deal with China production company Huayi Brothers, built out its executive team and revealed plans to release 12 to 15 films a year and spend $350 million to $400 million annually in media buying to promote its slate. In 2017, STX reeled in investment from media mogul John Malone’s Liberty Global.

STX launched a family division, a London-based international division led by David Kosse and an unscripted television unit from Jason Goldberg (which went on to produce Nat Geo’s Valley of the Boom) and also branched out into virtual reality projects (like Robert Rodriguez’s The Limit). The firm scored a hit with ensemble comedy Bad Moms ($183 million) in summer 2016 and then quickly greenlit a sequel, 2017’s A Bad Moms Christmas ($130 million). The studio teamed with Jennifer Lopez on 2018’s Second Act ($72 million) and then on Hustlers ($157 million) a year later. It also backed Chadwick Boseman actioner 21 Bridges ($49 million) and Guy Ritchie’s The Gentlemen ($115 million) in 2019.


By April 2020, STX had released 34 films during its run as an indie studio. The company, which had hoped to raise funds by listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, pulled those plans in 2018 amid unfavorable trading conditions. Instead, STX agreed to a stock-for-stock merger with India-based movie major Eros International, with the hope that the companies could combine to become a streaming powerhouse with Eros Now’s 26.2 million paid subscribers as a foundation. That bet didn’t pay off.

STX appeared to nab premium video-on-demand success with actioner Greenland in 2020, which also grossed $52 million overseas despite movie theater closures during the pandemic. In August 2021, STX began publicly shopping its film library in order to pay off $150 million-plus in debt.

“In a relatively short amount of time, STX has helped create and distribute over 70 movies, many with stars and filmmakers who have made multiple projects with us,” stated Noah Fogelson on Friday, adding of the deal close: “We’re thrilled that an investor as savvy as Jahm [Najafi] and The Najafi Companies see the value of the platform today, and also what’s possible tomorrow.”",Erik Hayden,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/stx-sold-to-investor-group-led-by-najafi-companies-1235084457/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/bad_moms_mila_kunis_kristen_bell_kathryn_hahn_still_3_h_2016.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
Showtime’s ‘The Man Who Fell to Earth’: TV Review,"No need to be sheepish. We’re among friends here. But raise your hand if the first few times you heard Sting’s “Englishman in New York,” you were convinced that the song, with its chorus beginning “I’m an alien/ I’m a legal alien,” was actually meant to be taken literally.

Sure, the song (apparently written about writer Quentin Crisp) is just about the alienating sense of being an outsider, of having people judge you for your accent or aspiring to civility in an uncivilized land. But it’s much more fun if it’s also about a spaceman.

It’s not adroit, or sensitive, to make a connection between aliens who come from outer space and people who cross borders from Mexico or Canada. It’s basically the premise of Alien Nation, V, two different television versions of Roswell and more sci-fi movies than I can count. That doesn’t mean it isn’t entertaining to see an allegory handled well, and Showtime’s The Man Who Fell to Earth uses the allegory as a solid point of entry before aiming for a greater exploration of what it means to be human and, more than that, to be the steward of an entire planet.


After an in medias res opening featuring Ejiofor’s character being celebrated as some kind of Bill Gates/Steve Jobs tech genius, we see him arrive, naked, deep in the New Mexico desert. He doesn’t speak English or understand human behavior. And when he basically swallows a hose attempting to consume an obscene amount of water, he’s arrested and interrogated by a friendly police officer named “K. Faraday” (Martha Plimpton in a small, but crucial cameo). He quickly picks up bits of language and decides to take Faraday’s name, which lets me stop discussing his character in such weirdly oblique terms.

Faraday is determined to make contact with Justin Falls (Naomie Harris), a former scientist whose failed attempts at cold fusion caused her to mostly drop off the grid. Justin is struggling to support her ailing father Josiah (Clarke Peters) — another former scientist who came over from the Bahamas as an “alien of extraordinary abilities” — and daughter (Annelle Olaleye).

But maybe Justin’s attempts at cold fusion didn’t exactly fail. Maybe she’s the only person who can help Faraday construct an energy device designed by Thomas Jerome Newton (Bill Nighy) — a device with the potential to save Faraday’s dying planet and maybe our dying planet as well. Yes, Newton is the character played by David Bowie in the movie and all you need to know is that he came to Earth, used patents from his alien technology to get wealthy and disappeared. Faraday needs Justin, but Justin wants no part of this stranger who seems to cause trouble wherever he goes.

Kurtzman, who directed the first four episodes, isn’t Nicolas Roeg, and makes no effort to replicate the haunting, beautiful and often surreal visuals from the movie. That doesn’t mean that The Man Who Fell to Earth isn’t eye-popping and ear-popping, with extreme camera angles and intrusive sound design capturing Faraday’s perspective on our world. It isn’t exactly surrealistic, but there are comparable elements of alienation and disorientation to how Faraday handles unfamiliar stimuli, positive and negative, on our apparently assaultive planet. The pilot in particular is probably the most assertive and distinctive thing that Kurtzman has ever directed, driven by well-utilized special effects, expressive use of widescreen Western visas and a revelatory Ejiofor.


Ejiofor is playing the Terminator as interpreted by Buster Keaton, calling attention to how Harris’ Justin is a lot like Sarah Connor with an advanced degree. The first two episodes rely too heavily on repeating Faraday’s intense desire to push forward on his mission and Justin’s confused reluctance. But her growing understanding of his needs and his growing understanding of the concept of empathy make for a dynamic that’s both prickly and sweet, compounded initially by the always welcome Peters and instantly likable Olaleye.

While you never doubt that Ejiofor’s performance is exactly as funny as he wants it to be, in the first two episodes he’s using that humor as a counterbalance to developing tension, not as something mirrored by the rest of the show.

That changes in the third episode with the introduction of the tightly wound Sonya Cassidy and a raucously disheveled Rob Delaney as bickering siblings still coping with the loss of their father and beginning to face the idea of a world beyond their comprehension. Would I compare the tone of those next two episodes to AMC’s dearly departed Lodge 49 were it not for Cassidy? Probably not. Because of Cassidy did I make that comparison, and enjoy the increasingly light and loopy episodes more as a result? Indubitably.

There’s a transition here from something rather in the vein of a ’70s thriller to a zippier, more Spielbergian adventure about estranged families and the friendly alien who uses his magic powers — among other things, Faraday can vomit up anything, which doesn’t sound like a gift, but occasionally is — to lead a spirited mission, while dark governmental forces lurk. Playing the smirking CIA agent who represents those dark governmental forces, Jimmi Simpson is essentially off in his own show.

Because of the shifts in tone and pacing, and the frequency with which Kurtzman and Lumet want to go from talking about immigration to global warming to a fuzzier cumulative idea of humanity, it still isn’t clear to me what The Man Who Fell to Earth is in the big picture. It isn’t immediately propulsive enough to feel like a limited series or instantly expansive enough to suggest there are five or six seasons of material here. With Ejiofor and the growing ensemble, at least there’s something to latch onto, if that whole “the fate of Earth and maybe the universe” thing isn’t quite as gripping as it should be.",Daniel Fienberg,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/the-man-who-fell-to-earth-review-1235133855/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/TheManwhofelltoearth-Publicity-H-2022-Aimee-Spinks-SHOWTIME.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter

TCM Classic Film Festival opening night

Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre rolled out the red carpet Thursday night to kick off the 2022 edition of the film festival. In doing so, they welcomed Steven Spielberg and his E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial collaborators to take a spin in the spotlight as they presented a special restored version of his beloved 1982 classic to celebrate the film’s 40th anniversary. Ahead of the screening, Spielberg sat down with TCM host Ben Mankiewicz for a 27-minute chat that covered his early career, how a moment on the Close Encounters of the Third Kind set sparked the idea for E.T. and how his experience filming the Melissa Mathison-penned project led to him wanting to become a father.

Baby2Baby Mother’s Day distribution presented by ByHeart and Paul Mitchell

Baby2Baby hosted hundreds of mothers and children living in poverty at an early Mother’s Day distribution event in Downtown Los Angeles on Thursday. Baby2Baby ambassador Jenna Dewan distributed items and gifts as she was joined by fellow stars Behati Prinsloo, Zoe Saldana and Desi. The event was presented by ByHeart and Paul Mitchell who helped make the day possible. “The mothers we serve have been struggling more than ever to get formula for their babies because we’re in the middle of a national formula shortage due to supply chain issues and recent recalls that have been particularly devastating for low-income families,” said Baby2Baby co-CEOs Norah Weinstein and Kelly Sawyer Patricof. “This event could not come at a more perfect time so we can celebrate hardworking moms and be able to give them what they really want–the essentials they need to keep their children healthy.”",Kirsten Chuba,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/lifestyle-news/euphoria-the-offer-red-carpet-premieres-1235132507/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/HBO-Max-FYC-Euphoria-Zendaya-GettyImages-1392667874-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
"Terry Crews Looks Back on Career, Life and Finding a “Place of Peace” in ‘Tough’ Memoir","In the opening pages of Terry Crews’ latest memoir, Tough, he writes of a night when everything changed.

In 2004, his acting career was taking off following his breakout performances in White Chicks and Friday After Next, with a role in the remake of The Longest Yard up next. While out for a celebratory dinner with his wife, he recalls being approached for an autograph. When one of the men spoke disrespectfully to his then-pregnant spouse, Crews writes that things quickly escalated into a “violent blur.” Despite almost being arrested, Crews was let go, later making a promise to his wife to refrain from getting violent should a similar situation arise again. But he also unknowingly would make a promise to himself to walk away from the man he had become over the years, ultimately jumpstarting a journey to what he describes as finding his “true power.”

Already having been vocal about the culture of toxic masculinity in his 2014 memoir, Manhood: How to Be a Better Man — or Just Live With One, Crews expands on that blueprint in his latest book, out Tuesday from Penguin Random House.

It’s not hard to see the similarities between his memoir’s opening story and the recent Oscars incident involving Will Smith and Chris Rock, with whom Crews worked on Everybody Hates Chris. The situation was one Crews could identify with — on both ends.

“Both Will Smith and Chris Rock are dear, dear friends of mine. I love them both as brothers, but there was a time in my life [where] I was Will Smith at that moment and let me tell you, I’ve done worse than Will — way overkill, just … the punishment did not fit the crime. Like people were like, ‘What in the world are you doing?’ My wife even had to be like, ‘You got to promise me you will never go off like this. You did not need to pick this man up and put him on his head, on the concrete,'” he tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Crews pinpoints the night former WME agent Adam Venit allegedly assaulted him at a party as one in which his controlled reaction “saved” his life, akin to how Rock reacted on the Oscars stage. “The toughness where I grew up and the way I was, it was always the ability to strike, the ability to punch, the ability to set things straight, to even the score. But the true definition of toughness was what Chris did in taking a punch and then holding everything together and then showing tremendous endurance and resilience in the middle of obstacles. … I’m very thankful to Chris, but also I understand Will. I’m not [one] to demonize Will at all because I was there.”


By detailing varied obstacles such as his addiction to pornography, coming forward with his sexual assault story and facing backlash following tweets about the Black Lives Matter movement, Crews examines how he went from once believing he was “broken” to assembling himself into the man and arriving at the “place of peace” he’s in today in a conversation with The Hollywood Reporter ahead of Tough’s release.

This now marks your second memoir after writing Manhood. Was there a plan to always write another one?

Actually, there wasn’t a plan to do another memoir. Then life started to happen (Laughs.) I wrote Manhood in 2014, but then there were so many things that happened over the last eight, nine years that my life totally changed. What was so incredible is I was asked so many times about so many things that I felt the need to write this book. Manhood kind of started a conversation that needed to continue. As a former, what I would call, “toxic male” — that term “toxic masculinity” has been used a lot, and it’s actually been misused. The term I really love right now is just “abuse of power” — and that really, really resonated with who I was; but then people just had more questions about how this goes down and what forms this, and how do you get control of this? Through all my therapy and through all my adventures over the last few years, I knew it was time and I was very grateful to get this opportunity.

You write about hardships that you faced personally while touching on a variety of topics, from your upbringing and parents to religion, race, addiction and money. It’s one thing to process and confront everything personally but another to now put it all on the page and share for readers. Was there anything you were hesitant or nervous to share with readers?

I was nervous about all of it! It’s so in-depth. It’s so revealing that it’s uncomfortable writing. What was so cathartic and wonderful about writing this book is that I found that in telling the story and actually revealing a lot of these things, they lose power over your life. So, take pornography [addiction], for example. It was what I called a “dirty little secret” for so many years, and as long as it was a secret, it could thrive. There was no reason for it to stop. Once I exposed it, first with people I love, in therapy and [with] family members, then I got the courage to go greater and bolder in going public with this. Now, I would never, ever recommend that people do things publicly. I would not. But the issue is I am already a public figure. I’m in the public eye. There’s never a place I walk where I don’t get stares and points literally since [my time] in the NFL [in] 1991. I’ve had some measure of fame, be it very small, like being on the football team, or being in the biggest movie in the world at the time. The fact that I was such a public figure meant that I could go public about who I am in the attempt to let people know that they weren’t alone. Because we always feel like we’re the only ones. I mean, I did. You feel like no one has this problem but me; everybody is fine; I’m the only one that’s messed up; I’m the only one going through this stuff. I had to let people know. I already have gotten so many people that said, “Man, wait a minute, the stuff you’re revealing, I thought I was the only guy [and] I thought I was the only person going through this stuff.” By you saying it, I’m like, “Oh my God, I’m not alone.” And that, to me, was worth revealing it.

I’d imagine it could be odd to call your memoir “timely,” but it kicks off with a story of you getting into an altercation with someone who disrespected your wife, which feels similar to the recent incident at the Oscars. What is it like to have your memoir release at a time when the things you touch on, such as toxic masculinity, are at the forefront of conversations, especially with people you’ve worked with before?

Both Will Smith and Chris Rock are dear, dear friends of mine. I love them both as brothers, but there was a time in my life [where] I was Will Smith at that moment, and let me tell you, I’ve done worse than Will. Way overkill, just … the punishment did not fit the crime. Like, people were like, “What in the world are you doing?” My wife even had to be like, “You got to promise me you will never go off like this. You did not need to pick this man up and put him on his head, on the concrete.” The minute I did it, I regretted it. I was like, “Why did I do this?” I couldn’t control myself. I literally had no control. If the wind went right, I was going right. If the wind went left, I was going left. And it wasn’t until I was Chris Rock literally in that moment — when I was assaulted by agent Adam Venit — and I chose to be in control. I chose to hold everything together. It could have descended into chaos. It would’ve been the end of me. When I look back, by what Chris did, by just deciding to hold everything together, it actually, I think in a lot of ways saved Hollywood. Because if there would’ve been a brawl on that stage, I don’t know if Hollywood would’ve ever gotten any respect again, you know? It’s hard to even imagine what would’ve happened.

The time that I was Chris was the time that saved my life. These things are tough — and this is another thing: The definition of toughness where I grew up and the way I was, it was always the ability to strike, the ability to punch, the ability to set things straight, to even the score. But the true definition of toughness was what Chris did in taking a punch and then holding everything together and then showing tremendous endurance and resilience in the middle of obstacles. I think it was a miracle what Chris did. I really do. I couldn’t believe his poise in that moment. I thought, holy cow, we owe him a lot. I think every performer owes him so much because it just really saved Hollywood in that moment. I’m very thankful to Chris, but also I understand Will. I’m not [one] to demonize Will at all because I was there. And that’s where I stand and I think it’s a perfect time to have this conversation and to really get upfront and close with these things that have always plagued us. I mean, it’s just one thing that travels in politics and sports and Hollywood, it’s that ability for people to just go off for no reason and not even understand why they’re doing it. Especially when I look at the way I was and to where I am now, another reason I had to reveal a lot is because you had to see where I was to understand where I am now. I have people now that can’t even imagine the things I did in the book that look at me and I’m like, “Hey man, that was me. And I have to let you know.” And this is the same place I feel Will is in, and because people still are trying hard to rectify the Will Smith they knew with that person that was there at the Academy Awards, but he’s the same person, you know what I mean? We all have to understand that that could be any of us.

Right. I think in any situation it’s so easy to automatically want to pinpoint one person as the hero and the other as a villain rather than actually just acknowledging that people are people.

That’s right, especially when everything is done in like a hundred characters [on social media] and people tend to create villains and heroes real quick and everything’s black and white. But there’s a lot of nuance. This is where a nice, long talk needs to happen. You can’t blurb this at all.

Or perhaps a reading of your book?

(Laughs.) Thank you! Again, no one planned this. I told the publisher, “I’ll be straight honest with you: This may be the most important thing I ever do, past movies, past all the entertainment, past everything I’ve ever done. This may be it.” My life changed. I can’t imagine where I would be had I hit that agent and I knocked him out. I promise you I would not be here today. I don’t know where I would be, but it wouldn’t be in this spot that I’m in now.

When reading your stories and recollections, it seemed as if once you confronted one thing about yourself or a situation, that led to yet another layer to confront and come to terms with.

I like to call it the dominoes. One thing you realize is if you clean one room in your house, it all of a sudden makes the rest of the house very, very dirty. You’re like, “This room is spotless, but the kitchen, however!” That’s what happened. It was literally getting one segment of my life together, and it highlighted how all the other things were off. There’s a lot said for work-life balance. People say, “How do you balance work and life?” But the true balance I feel that people need is [that] external success needs to even out with your internal success because what I was was externally successful but internally a failure. Once I began to rectify and work on the internal, my life changed dramatically. Being internally and externally successful is a place of peace. It really just heals so many parts of my life. That’s the balance that I’m concerned with, and the balance that I hope many, many people find through reading this book.

You write about moving through your early roles in Training Day, Friday After Next and White Chicks, and even after finding success, internally struggling with anxiety. You said that you weren’t doing well enough and felt depressed as soon as you got home after projects were done. So you’d be a workaholic as a means to not have downtime and be alone in your head.

It was horrible! What I had done is, I had determined my worth through the opinions of other people. So, it was like, if everyone loved me then I was great. But if I wasn’t working, I was horrible. I was a failure. When you determine your self-worth off of everyone else’s opinions and ideas of you, it’s a horrible place to be. I was never satisfied. I was always looking for the next pat on the back or the next laugh, and it had to be continuous. This drives a lot of entertainers [and] it drives a lot of people in the entertainment business, and sometimes it can lead to your downfall. It feeds addictions. It feeds all kinds of things. Because you got to feed the beast or you’re going to be nothing and that’s a really, really lonely, hard-core place to be.

How has your perspective on how you carry on in your career changed? What kind of boundaries do you set for yourself that you continue to hold on to to this day after recognizing the mindset you would have when it came to work?

Tough releases on April 26. Penguin Random House

It was the internal success. It was feeling good about myself because I was just me. As entertainers, you’re perfectionists, but you’ll never do anything perfect. So you’re always feeling disappointed about a performance. You’re totally insecure all the time. But I became secure in just [thinking], “Did I do my best?” And the answer was yes. Then I became very, very satisfied with that, and it started to grow. This is the thing: Your thoughts determine your feelings. What I had to do was start changing the way I thought about myself, and then I felt better about myself. But what was happening before was that I was thinking bad thoughts about me. I thought, “I’m not any good.” A lot of performers suffer from imposter syndrome where things are good, but you don’t see it as good, you see it as: You’re a fake and maybe you’re just lucky; you’re not really talented; you didn’t really earn this. I had to tell myself, wait a minute, I did earn it. I started to change those thoughts, and then I changed the feelings, and all of a sudden I felt great about just being me, and it didn’t matter what other people thought or said or whether I was working or not. It was wonderful.

Reflecting on working on the 2014 film Blended, you describe it as one of the most important films of your career given you spoke up about the issues with your role and you were able to rework your character given how originally offensive it was in the script. How did that experience influence your approach to assessing what projects and/or roles you take on, and how involved you are with those roles?

Oh, it was a life-changer because when you think you’re nobody [and] when you think it’s all about what everyone else thinks, you’re going to be scared to speak up because no one wants to hear you. But the moment I challenged that [and] I put myself out there, I said, wait a minute, I am viable. My opinion does matter. I can choose how I’m going to do this and I can bring it up to everyone else. Once I did that and it got accepted and it was through the roof a hit, I was like, oh my God, this is what I’ve been missing. It’s all a journey. It’s kind of like a chess match. Sometimes you have to move forward, sometimes you move backward and you move all over the board, but every move counts. It kind of highlights whether you win in the game or not. I had to go through a lot of different things in order to get to this place. One quote I love is, “Sometimes your greatest hopes are destroyed to prepare you for something better.” As an actor, you face tons of rejection, but each rejection gets you closer to the goal. It’s impossible to do this without those kinds of lumps. Once I found my voice — and it takes some years, takes time — and it went well, once I did that and I was doing Brooklyn Nine-Nine, and I started hosting, I just felt this wave of real, true confidence that was backed up by action. So, it was really, really healing for me. My performances were just wonderful things but not judgments every time I did anything. I didn’t go up and down. It was just another great thing to do and you get better and better when you do it. So, I feel so fortunate. Again, that’s one reason I wrote the book, to let people know that I’m not special. Like, you can do this too. I’m not the only one. Hopefully, you can get inspired by the story and you can find your own way, but you can find a way.

You touched on this earlier, but another difficult but life-changing moment you also reflect on is coming forward and speaking up about your sexual assault story. How do you feel about how everything went down and about that chapter closing with the agent resigning? How has your relationship with the industry changed since?

I feel like that’s literally probably the most important thing I’ve ever done, ever. When you’re talking about the inadequacy that most actors feel, the helplessness that people feel and going for their dreams, and then having it be manipulated or facing stuff like sexual assault in this business, it’s so normal that it became part of the lexicon. I was so inspired by those women [who came forward during the #MeToo movement] and it got to a point where if I remained silent, I knew that I wouldn’t be honest. The only way for me to be honest was to join the fight. Because I saw how they were taking a lot of lumps and people were calling them all kinds of names and [saying] they deserved it and this is what you got to do to get in Hollywood, and I knew the only way that people could really understand it, especially men, was if a man stood up. Because this was always looked at before as a woman’s issue. I think with me and several other men who came forward, it became a human issue. For the first time, people got to see this whole issue in 3D. I’m so thankful. And even today, like right now, it’s changed the fabric of Hollywood and I’m sure it’s still there to some degree. But now, being an example, men do have several examples that they can say, “Wait a minute, you crossed my boundary and I don’t have to put up with this.” I feel so good about [the whole experience] because they literally told me that because of how popular, and he was a partner and how big he was, that he had more rights than me, but you don’t have more rights than any other human being. If it was somebody in the mailroom, they would’ve been fired immediately. It’s this thing where, you know, the Hollywood system has always been, whoever is the big boss gets a pass. But no one gets a pass. Then toxic male culture, it is almost like running a business by the rules of the bench press. And you’re like, but that makes no sense. You have to make it make sense. Everyone has to be protected, every person.

You also write about the criticism over your tweets about the Black Lives Matter movement. You reflect in great detail on where you were coming from and acknowledge the mistakes you made. When looking back, how do you view that moment and the aftermath?

It’s kind of like I said [about] that chess game where we were all trying to figure things out. This is where I stand on the whole thing: Any movement I felt that didn’t start with reconciliation between Black and white, men and women, Republican, Democrat, it has to start there because if you don’t start it with reconciliation, you’re basically just postponing a war. I just wanted everyone to know that I wanted to unify with good people, Black, white, any race, creed, color, anyone that was willing to talk reconciliation because, you know, it’s not a sport. The thing is, there’s no winners or losers. This is a house that we all have to live in. You can’t take your ball and go home, and I can’t take my ball and go home. We have to be here and we have to live here. Reconciliation doesn’t mean agreement, doesn’t mean we have to agree, but we do have to reconcile. I did not feel that there was enough emphasis put on reconciliation. I felt that it was a little bit of line drawing … a lot of finger-pointing. And I just wanted to be clear about where I stood and where I felt we needed to be as a country and as a nation. It was a really, really volatile time and I understand the emotional feelings. Even facing backlash, I understand that, but again, I’m in a place now where I don’t have to judge myself by what other people think. That’s part of the therapy. That was part of getting through Hollywood. Because all I did was care about what other people thought of me. Now when you have this, you can see things a lot clearer. I wasn’t trying to hurt anybody or insult anybody. This was where I felt I could lend some really positive input into the conversation.

You write that social media is not built for any kind of nuanced, reasoned discussion and that there are better mediums for expression. Going forward, how has your perspective changed on how and what you share on social media?


Nothing wrong with that! At another point in your memoir, you write about being at a crossroads of who you were, with the line blurring between the person you described as the “real” Terry and the one you felt you had to be. Who would you say is Terry Crews now and what would you hope that people understand or know about you?


While looking back on your journey and life, what surprised you the most? What are you the proudest of, and what do you envision for the future?

The thing that hit me the most was last year when I got the star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. One reason why I’m so, so proud [is] my grandmother, she just turned 95, but she was 94 at the time. She’s from the little town Edison, Georgia, less than 300 people and she’d never been to California. We flew her out for this ceremony and she just was looking and she could not believe [it], and this is a woman whose husband abandoned her and she held the whole family together. She’s the reason why I’m here today. I mean, this is my grandmother and you’re talking about growing up in the Jim Crow South, and she [has] seen the horrors of probably the worst of the civil rights era and to see her grandson get that star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame and she was so proud of me, that’s all I needed. It was like to fulfill her, to let her know that her sacrifice was worth it. She sat there with such pride and all the pain that she went through, it wasn’t for anything. She lived to see it.

What do you hope readers take away from this memoir?

A real big thing I want people to take away is that you are not broken. You are assembly required. A lot of times, you get a Lego set and the whole thing and everything is shaking and it’s all in pieces. The competitive world tells you that you’re broken, especially worlds like sports, [and] entertainment, they’ll say you don’t have it. But the trick is you’re not broken. You’re just not assembled. You’re not finished. And what hit me is that I needed to assemble. I needed to take out the bad parts, put in new Legos (laughs), put in new parts and put together a new me that was better, that worked. Because there were so many things that weren’t working and people just told me it was automatic. Through therapy, I learned I wasn’t broken. I just wasn’t finished and I started to work on myself. When I say “true power,” that’s what it is. You literally just continually work on yourself. One thing I always say is that you telling everyone what to do does not make you the boss, but you doing everything you told yourself to do makes you the boss. It’s the internal stuff. Assemble yourself and man, your life will change. I’m a prime example of that. I changed.

When it comes to television, anytime a series ends, it doesn’t necessarily mean it’s the end anymore. I’ve read that you are already pitching ideas for a Brooklyn Nine-Nine film. Is that something you’re still interested in?

Oh my God. I am definitely still interested. I still think we could do a heist movie. (Laughs.) We always had our yearly heist episode and I think that would be brilliant, especially with Peacock and all the great things that NBC can already do. I think that every castmember will be down for us to do a nice hour and a half episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, make it three episodes all involving the heist and a new heist and it would be all wonderful. I love, love, love my castmates. I spent eight years with these guys and they’re truly family, and I miss them every day.

You guys can make your own James Bond franchise of just heist movies.

(Laughs.) That’s right! We’ll go into theaters, and then a few weeks later we’ll be on Peacock!

Former InStyle Editor Laura Brown to Debut Clubhouse Conversation Series ‘Ladies Night’ (Exclusive),"Laura Brown will soon be hosting ladies’ night on Clubhouse.

The high-profile InStyle editor-in-chief — who departed the magazine when its publisher, Dotdash Meredith, announced it was switching from print to a digital-only publication — will debut Ladies Night with Laura Brown on May 5. The limited series will find Brown engaging a slew of stars in “fun, candid conversations across a myriad of topics like ambition, relationships, and of course, style.” Michelle Dockery, Elle Fanning, Sophie Turner, Rebel Wilson and Odessa Young are booked with more names expected in the coming weeks. Joining her in the club at Clubhouse will be another well-respected InStyle vet, Glynis Costin, who is on board to produce the series.

Chelsea Macdonald, head of entertainment partnerships at Clubhouse, said she’s admired the pair’s work over the years, citing “Laura’s magnetic interviewing style and Glynis’ eye for talent.” Macdonald added: “So when they both came on board for this show, I was elated. Both are legacy innovators within entertainment, fashion, and publishing, so we’re excited that Clubhouse can provide their next creative endeavor into social audio.”

Brown, who served as the mag’s top editor from 2016 until February, called it “thrilling” to be able to “talk to listeners in real-time, on a platform with a global reach far exceeding that of a publishing brand. And it’s always five o’clock somewhere.” Ladies Night with Laura Brown follows a similar chat show she hosted during her InStyle tenure titled Ladies First. Throughout her career, Brown has interviewed big names like Michelle Obama, Oprah Winfrey, Rihanna, Jennifer Aniston, Zendaya and countless other A-List stars. The beloved Aussie joined InStyle after a decade-plus run at Harper’s Bazaar.

Costin, who segued to launch her own firm, Costin Consulting, served as the West Coast bureau chief for InStyle for an impressive 22 years. She’s known for having a keen eye for talent and strong industry relationships thanks to booking more than 400 covers during her long tenure. She also booked A-list events like the InStyle Awards, Badass Women dinners and countless awards season parties. She also penned features on Sandra Bullock, Kerry Washington, Holly Hunter and Sterling K. Brown, among many others.

“I’m excited to be working with Clubhouse on this new series and to be partnering again with Laura who is such a natural conversationalist,” said Costin. “The show will feel like an intimate chat among friends who are out for cocktails or coffee — it’s about having fun.”


As for Clubhouse, the pandemic phenomenon launched in March 2020 and has since hosted conversations with Adam McKay, Oprah Winfrey (recapping her Adele interview), Zoe Saldana, Reese Witherspoon, Tiffany Haddish and Snoop Dogg, to name but a few.",Chris Gardner,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/laura-brown-clubhouse-ladies-night-1235133762/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1385591676-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter
Diddy to Host Billboard Music Awards 2022 – The Hollywood Reporter,"Music mogul/producer/rapper Sean “Diddy” Combs will host and executive produce the 2022 Billboard Music Awards. The hosting duties for the Bad Boy boss come exactly 25 years after Combs took home his first BBMA in 1997 for his multi-platinum No Way Out album.

“This will be unlike any awards show — I’m bringing the love and setting the frequency at an all-time high,” said two-time BBMA winner Combs in a statement about his run at producing the show, which the release promises will include a reimagining of the broadcast that will feature several surprises. “The Billboard Music Awards truly represent the artists and where music is today, so I’m excited to curate the biggest live performances and surprises. The world has to tune in to see.”

The multi-hyphenate actor, fashion designer, investor, entrepreneur and philanthropist will oversee the May 15 event that will air live coast-to-coast from the MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas at 8 p.m. ET on NBC; it will also stream on the Peacock service.

As previously announced, the 2022 BBMAs will honor Mary J. Blige with the Icon Award, with Blige slated to perform on the broadcast along with Burna Boy, Latto, Megan Thee Stallion, Rauw Alejandro, the Red Hot Chili Peppers and more artists set to be announced soon.

The Weeknd is the leading contender for the 2022 BBMAS, with nominations in 17 categories, including top artist, top male artist and top Hot 100 artist. His collaboration with Ariana Grande, “Save Your Tears (Remix),” is up for six awards.

Doja Cat is the leading female finalist with 14 nods, including top artist, top female artist and top Hot 100 artist. Her album Planet Her is a finalist for two awards, while her Grammy-winning smash “Kiss Me More,” featuring SZA, is up for top Hot 100 song and top collaboration, as well as in the new top viral song category.

Justin Bieber, Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Olivia Rodrigo each have 13 nods. Bieber is the third-most decorated artist in BBMA history, with 21 previous wins. He trails only Drake (29 wins) and Taylor Swift (25). All three of these artists are finalists in multiple categories this year, so these rankings could shift.

The 2022 BBMAs are produced by MRC Live & Alternative (a division of MRC, which is a co-owner of The Hollywood Reporter and Billboard through a joint venture with Penske Media titled P-MRC), with Diddy and Robert Deaton serving as executive producers.

"Alison Brie’s ‘Spin Me Round’ SXSW Comedy Acquired By AMC+, IFC Films","IFC Films and AMC+ have picked up the North American rights to director Jeff Baena’s comedy Spin Me Round, co-written with lead and frequent collaborator Alison Brie.

IFC Films will release the movie in theaters, on VOD and it will stream exclusively on AMC+ this summer.

In Spin Me Round, Brie stars as the manager of an Italian restaurant chain who wins the opportunity to attend the franchise’s educational immersion program in Italy. What she thought would be a romantic getaway becomes chaos and catastrophe. The ensemble cast includes Alessandro Nivola, Aubrey Plaza, Molly Shannon, Zach Woods, Ayden Mayeri and Ben Sinclair.

Spin Me Round marks the third IFC Films feature with Brie, who most recently starred in The Rental, the Dave Franco-directed thriller. “We have long admired Jeff Baena’s films and are thrilled to have the opportunity to partner with him and his incredible filmmaking team on this fun and hilarious ride,” Arianna Bocco, IFC Films president, said in a statement.

Why This 12-Year-Old Actor Kept Role as Young Bruce Wayne in ‘The Batman’ a Secret From Classmates,"Following the March release of Matt Reeves’ The Batman, some of Oscar Novak’s friends cornered him at school with a pressing question: Was that you on the big-screen?

The 12-year-old admitted that, yes, it was him starring as a young Bruce Wayne in the Warner Bros. film, a confirmation that also revealed an occupation he’d kept to himself. “They had no clue that I was in The Batman or even an actor,” Novak told The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night outside Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre, host of The Northman premiere. “Then I had to go through the whole thing of explaining it to them. So, it’s a little bit awkward but yeah, it’s very cool.”

Novak, 12, offered up a simple reason for why he kept his big-screen debut a secret: “I thought it would be too much hassle.” Fortunately, for him, he says the burden wasn’t too heavy back at his school in England, though he’s bracing himself for another round.

Only one friend knows that he followed up The Batman by playing the young version of Alexander Skarsgård’s character in The Northman for director Robert Eggers. That’s because they spotted him in the trailer as young Amleth, a vicious Viking prince who spends the majority of the film seeking to avenge his father’s murder.

“I know it’s going to be very difficult, but I’ll do my best to explain it to them,” he says, adding that he was able to sneak away because the premiere coincided with Easter holiday break.

As for his work on The Northman, Novak praised Eggers for guiding his process and being a consummate professional. “He really is a perfectionist. There have been multiple occasions where we’ve done like 30 plus takes just to get the perfect scene. But he’s really sweet. He’s really nice in the way he does it,” says Novak. “He can tell if someone needs a break. It’s very nice.”

The back-to-back projects landed Novak a new agent so he may soon have more to divulge to his classmates. “There’s a lot more on my plate. I’ve got auditions coming in left, right and center.”

The Northman hits theaters in the U.S. on April 22.

"AMC Theatres Inks Deal With Cinionic to Install Laser Projectors in 3,500 U.S. Auditoriums","In what it describes as its first major broadscale projector upgrade since the transition to digital, AMC Theatres has signed an agreement with Cinionic to install Barco laser projectors in 3,500 of its U.S. auditoriums through 2026. Announced just prior to the start of theater owners confab CinemaCon, which opens Monday in Las Vegas, AMC will brand these auditoriums as “Laser at AMC.”

The equipment investment is valued at about $250 million, according to the companies, though the deal has been made through Cinionic’s “Cinema-as-a-Service” program, meaning there’s a performance-driven service agreement through which Cinionic maintains ownership of the equipment.

Projector makers have been moving toward laser-based systems, which offer brighter images and more contrast than those with xenon lamps. In addition to Laser at AMC, the theater chain offers laser projection in its Premium Large Format auditoriums: Dolby Cinema at AMC, PRIME at AMC, and select Imax at AMC, as well as in recent new-build openings.

“For the last two years as AMC has navigated its way through the pandemic, we have done so not only with the intention of survival, but with an eye to the future of moviegoing and continuing to enhance the guest experience at our theatres,” said Adam Aron, chairman and CEO of AMC. “Through our wonderful Premium Large Format partnerships with IMAX and Dolby, AMC is firmly established as the industry leader in premium experiences. Laser at AMC, powered by Cinionic, allows us to bring a premium on-screen presentation to hundreds of our theatres and thousands of auditoriums around the country, for a greener way to go to the movies, with only a minimal capital investment.”

Later this year, AMC and Cinionic will begin the installation process, with the full initiative expected to be completed by the end of 2026.

Barco partner Cinionic estimates that roughly 30,000 Barco laser projectors are currently installed in theaters worldwide. “At Cinionic, we’re in this for the long-term,” said CEO Wim Buyens. “The partnership with AMC enables a consistent, elevated, and laser-powered big screen experience for the next generation.”",Carolyn Giardina,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/amc-cinionic-laser-projectors-deal-1235133966/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-1307671685-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter

REUTERS/Gleb Garanich

April 22 (Reuters) - Children in Kyiv, including evacuees from other parts of the country, decorated traditional Ukrainian Easter eggs on Friday - but this year they have taken on a more patriotic tone.

""Many people are diverting from tradition a little, not drawing the usual images like stars, flowers,"" said Mariya Poshyvailo, who works at the Ivan Honchar Museum National Centre of Folk Culture.

""Instead, they want to draw something current, like Ukraine's trident symbol, or write slogans like 'Glory to Ukraine', 'Glory to the Heroes'. What is close to them.""

Nine-year old Bohdana was evacuated from the northern Ukrainian region of Chernihiv, which suffered from heavy Russian military activity.

Ahead of Orthodox Easter on April 24, she was painting her egg in orange and gold. ""It's the continuation of life... happiness,"" she said.

The 'pysanky' eggs, decorated with beeswax and dye, will be carried to Kyiv's Maidan square at a memorial for ""the Heavenly Hundred,"" a reference to the more than 100 protesters that were gunned down in the Maidan uprising that toppled President Viktor Yanukovich in 2014.

""This is, firstly, a symbol of life,"" said Tetyana Poshyvaylo, deputy head of the Ivan Honchar Museum. ""I am holding a nucleus of this, the birth of life. And it has always strengthened us and is the amulet of the house.""

The head of Ukraine's Orthodox church asked clergy and the faithful this week to forgo night-time Easter services in areas of the country affected by fighting, fearing Russian bombardments will continue during the Orthodox Easter period.

'Washington Crossing the Delaware' up for auction at Christie's in May,"NEW YORK, April 22 (Reuters) - The famous ""Washington Crossing the Delaware"" painting, which hung in the White House from the 1970s to 2014, is coming up for auction next month, when it is estimated to fetch about $20 million.

The 1851 oil painting is one of three versions painted by Emanuel Leutze of the man who was to be the first U.S. president leading troops during a key moment of the American revolution. Only two survive.

The first version was destroyed during a World War Two air raid in Germany, said American Art specialist Paige Kestenman at Christie's New York.

""The second is the monumental work that is the centerpiece of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's American Wing, and the third is this work right here,"" said Kestenman.

The version at New York's Met measures 12.4 ft x 21.25 ft (3.78 m x 6.48 m). The painting up for sale on May 12 is smaller - about 3 ft (0.9 m) by 6 ft (1.83 m). It had hung for decades in the White House, mainly in the West Wing reception room.

The work depicts George Washington leading soldiers across the Delaware River to surprise the infantry hiding on the other side on Christmas Night, 1776, Kestenman said.

""A German-born American immigrant, Leutze was also a staunch abolitionist and in 'Washington crossing the Delaware' he deliberately included a variety of the figures that make up the melting pot that formed the American nation,"" said Kestenman.

She pointed out a Black soldier, another soldier wearing a Scottish bonnet, and moccasins and buckskin clothing suggesting the American West and Native Americans.

Thai rapper Milli's mango sticky rice munching boosts beloved dessert,"April 22 (Reuters) - Fans of Thai rapper, Milli, had a hankering for mango sticky rice in Bangkok this week after the 19-year-old ate mouthfuls of the much-loved dessert on stage at the Coachella music festival in the United States.


Sales in Thailand jumped after Milli brought a bowl of the popular dessert on stage and took a few bites as she performed a song called ""Mango Sticky Rice"" last weekend.

Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said this week the Culture Ministry is considering registering mango sticky rice on UNESCO's cultural heritage list, local media TPBS reported.

Thais eat the dessert, which consists of sweet sticky rice steeped in coconut milk, served with ripe mango, to cool themselves off in the exceptionally humid months of March and April.

In the capital Bangkok, dozens of delivery riders were seen queuing up in front of a well-known vendor called Mae Varee to fulfil surging online orders.

""We had to shut down the apps in order to catch up with the orders before resuming it again. We've been turning it on and off, on and off throughout the day,"" Thanyarat Suntiparadorn, 29, the owner of Mae Varee told Reuters.

Thanyarat said that while mangoes are already in season, Milli's performance helped increase sales more than 100%.

Customers also flocked to Bangkok's Chinatown area where vendors had to double their mango stocks to keep up with demand.

""I normally love to eat mango sticky rice but ... after watching Milli on stage, I am now eating it nearly every day,"" said 29-year-old customer, Suphakomkao Klaypongpan.

Its March 29 debut, ahead of parent company WarnerMedia's April 8 merger with Discovery, sparked speculation about its fate as a stand-alone service.

Warner Bros Discovery's global streaming president, J.B. Perrette, said in a statement that the CNN brand and its content will be part of a more comprehensive streaming offering. The company also operates HBO Max and Discovery+, two services the company has said it plans to combine.

Alec Baldwin's lawyer says state's 'Rust' shooting probe clears actor,"Host Alec Baldwin arrives at the 2nd Annual NFL Honors in New Orleans, Louisiana, February 2, 2013. REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson

April 21 (Reuters) - A lawyer for Alec Baldwin said on Thursday that an investigation by New Mexico has cleared his client of wrongdoing in the fatal shooting on the set of ""Rust,"" pointing out that its report stated the actor believed his gun held only dummy rounds.

New Mexico's Occupational Health and Safety Bureau on Wednesday released the findings of a six-month investigation of the shooting during the filming of the Western movie last October. It blasted Rust Movie Productions LLC for ""willful"" safety lapses leading to the death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins and fined the company $137,000, the maximum amount possible. read more

In response to the findings, Baldwin's attorneys said in a statement that his authority on the production was limited to approving script changes and creative casting and that he had no authority over matters that were subject to the investigation.

""We appreciate that the report exonerates Mr. Baldwin by making clear that he believed the gun held only dummy rounds,"" the statement posted on Baldwin's Instagram account said. ""We are pleased that the New Mexico officials have clarified these critical issues.""

The agency was not immediately available to comment on the statement.

Hutchins was killed during a rehearsal when a revolver that Baldwin was holding fired a live round that passed through her and struck the movie's director Joel Souza in the shoulder, wounding him.

The investigation found the production firm had been aware that firearm safety procedures were not being followed and demonstrated ""plain indifference"" to the hazards, the New Mexico Environment Department said in a statement.

Rust Movie Productions spokesman Stefan Friedman said in a statement on Wednesday that the company disagreed with the findings and planned to appeal.

The probe found that Rust management ignored concerns raised by crew members about firearm and pyrotechnics misfires on set.

The report said Rust management failed to give staff responsible for firearms safety sufficient time to inspect ammunition received to ensure no live rounds were present.

The Santa Fe County Sheriff's Office and the Santa Fe County District Attorney have ongoing criminal investigations into the death of the cinematographer.

Kapow! U.S. comic book stars raise money for Ukraine refugees,"April 21 (Reuters) - Like Batman forming the Justice League of superheroes, or Iron Man helping assemble the Avengers, comic book editor Scott Dunbier needed to put together a team of stars.

The call went out and Dunbier quickly signed up the biggest names in the U.S. comic book industry to collaborate on a special anthology to raise money for Ukrainian war refugees.

The result is ""Comics for Ukraine: Sunflower Seeds,"" a 96-page book produced by the best writers, artists, colorists, letterers, designers and editors that Dunbier could find.

Proceeds, estimated to reach $200,000 to $500,000, will go to Operation USA, a Los Angeles-based disaster relief agency raising money for Ukrainian war refugees. Over five million Ukrainians have fled abroad since Russia invaded on Feb. 24.

By Thursday, three days after launching, it had raised $78,000 on the Zoop crowdfunding site. The publication date remains uncertain, depending on how much is raised through pre-orders after a month, Dunbier said.

As many comic books do, the Ukraine project has an origin story.

""It was basically me being glued to my TV watching the horror, the atrocities unfold, and just feeling like I had to do something. And, you know, then it clicked. I thought in some small way, maybe this would help,"" Dunbier said.

The project makes no pretense of being unbiased, depicting Ukraine as David confronting the Russian Goliath.

His cover shows a Ukrainian wielding a shield and a sword before a giant bear, nose bloodied, who is surprised to meet resistance. The sword has impaled a teddy bear resembling Russian President Vladimir Putin.

Others donating work include Brent Anderson, Sergio Aragones, June Brigman, Kurt Busiek, Howard Chaykin, Joshua Dysart, Mark Evanier, Emil Ferris, Dave Gibbons, Rob Guillory, John Layman, Gabriel Rodriguez, Stan Sakai, Louise Simonson, Walter Simonson, Chris Sprouse, Jill Thompson, Matt Wagner and Mark Waid.

While some of the stories are set in Ukraine, others are allegorical.

Sakai is creator of the Usagi Yojimbo comic, about a rabbit warrior set in feudal Japan. His story depicts villagers being run off by an evil warlord, Dunbier said.

Queen Elizabeth's 96th birthday marked with gun salutes,"LONDON, April 21 (Reuters) - Queen Elizabeth celebrated her 96th birthday at her Sandringham estate on Thursday as gun salutes rang out across London and Windsor and military bands played ""Happy Birthday"".

Britain's longest serving monarch, who celebrates a historic platinum jubilee this year, was pictured with two white ponies in a photo released for the occasion.

Government ministers joined members of the royal family in sending their best wishes to the queen, who has stepped back from most public duties this year over concerns about her health.

She has travelled from Windsor Castle, west of London, to spend her birthday at her estate in Sandringham, Norfolk.

""An inspiration to so many across the UK, the Commonwealth and the world, it's particularly special to be celebrating in this Platinum Jubilee year,"" her grandson Prince William and his wife Kate said on Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is visiting India, wished the queen a happy birthday and paid a ""heartfelt tribute"" to her ""70 years of dedicated and faultless service to our country and the Commonwealth"" in a video message.

Toymaker Mattel launched a commemorative Barbie doll of the queen dressed in an ivory gown with a blue sash and wearing her wedding tiara to mark the jubilee.

Elizabeth became the queen of Britain and more than a dozen other realms including Canada, Australia and New Zealand on the death of her father King George VI on Feb. 6, 1952, while she was in Kenya on an international tour.

The news was broken to her by her husband Prince Philip, who died last year aged 99 after more than seven decades by her side.

When she ascended the throne, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong and Harry Truman were running the Soviet Union, China and the United States, respectively, while Winston Churchill was British prime minister.

Elizabeth has largely avoided the public spotlight after spending a night in hospital in October for an unspecified ailment and being ordered to rest. She tested positive for COVID-19 in February and has said she was left very tired.

She has missed events including the Remembrance Sunday gathering and Easter service, but she joined other members of her family and dignitaries at a memorial service for her husband at London's Westminster abbey last month.

Easter chants echo in ancient cistern near birthplace of Christianity,"JERUSALEM, April 23 (Reuters) - A few steps from Jerusalem’s Church of the Holy Sepulchre, a small opening leads to an underground cistern where clerics have found the perfect place to practise chants ahead of the holiest day in the Christian calendar.

As Eastern churches prepared to mark Easter one week after the Roman Catholic celebration, Barakat al-Masri stood deep underneath Saint Helena's Coptic Orthodox church, chanting hymns in Coptic and Arabic.

The cistern is not much to look at, but al-Masri, the cantor at the Coptic church, says the sound it produces is unique.

""There’s an echo,” the 35-year-old Egyptian-born student of Coptic languages and music told Reuters at the bottom of a winding subterranean staircase in the build-up to Holy Week.

“Many people come here and record themselves singing because the sound is as if you are in a studio, perhaps even better.”

“The Coptic melodies are some of the church’s treasures. They have been passed down to us from our ancestors as early as the first century,” he said.

""I record here as much as possible.""

The cistern is named after Saint Helena, the mother of Constantine, who was the first Roman emperor to embrace Christianity.

According to historical accounts, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built in the fourth century, after she visited the site and proclaimed it to be the place where Jesus was crucified and resurrected.

Picture taken April 14, 2022. REUTERS/Ammar Awad Read More

Saints and some of the first Christians relied on water from the cistern during the construction of the church, “making the water holy,” said Jerusalem tour guide Bashar Abu Shamsiyeh.

The water channels that used to fill it are closed now, and the cistern is no longer in use, he said. But the church keeps it open for visitors, even though it is off the usual tourist trail.

“This is the first time anybody brings us here,” said Gabi Rahil, 70, a Palestinian Christian originally from Bethlehem in the occupied West Bank.

“They could use lights,” he muttered as he walked down the slippery, dimly lit, stairs before realizing his voice was echoing.

“I was expecting some small well or something. I wasn’t expecting an underground cave,” said Kyna Finch, 25, a tourist from Britain.

“It seems like a very special, peaceful place, removed from the hustle and bustle outside,” she added. “We saw a lot of people coming this direction and so we decided to check it out.”

Jorge Cases, 36, a tourist from Spain, said he discovered the cistern by accident.

“I’m surprised I hadn’t even seen it pop up anywhere while reading about and researching (this trip),” he said. “It’s a pretty magical place.”

He tested the echo to the beat of water dripping from the ceiling, first by humming, then clapping, then whistling.

“It’s better that I don’t sing,” he said.

Combat sports-Ice Wars promises 'prize fighting on ice',"LOS ANGELES, April 21 (Reuters) - Upstart combat sports league ""Ice Wars"" will pit ice hockey enforcers against each other in a rink next month but instead of scoring the puck, the goal is to knock your opponent out cold.

""I'm calling it prize fighting on ice because at the end of the day, there is no hockey being played,"" Ice Wars president A.J. Galante told Reuters.

""There are no sticks, there are no pucks, there are no nets. So yes, it's full hockey gear and it will predominantly be current hockey players. But it's prize fighting with a purse on the line.""

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

As a teenager, Galante's father made him the general manager of the now-defunct Danbury Trashers, a minor league team so violent and controversial that last year it became the subject of the Netflix documentary ""Untold: Crime and Penalties"".

He moved on to boxing and said the wave of interest in innovative combat sports - everything from bare knuckle boxing to pillow fighting has grabbed headlines recently - led him to believe the time was right to launch his passion project.

A bout will consist of two, one-minute rounds with a 30-second ""ice breaker"" in the event that the fighters split the rounds.

The fighters will wear 4-ounce MMA gloves and cannot intentionally take their opponent's helmet off. But if it comes off as the result of a great punch, it's ""game on,"" said Galante.

The concept dates back to the ""Battle of the Hockey Enforcers"", an event that was held in British Columbia in 2005 and served as an inspiration for Ice Wars.


Ice warrior Daniel Amesbury said he is eager to showcase his talent.

""As crazy as it might sound, this is something that I've always had in the back of my mind,"" Amesbury said.

""Six months ago I was saying to my buddy that it's too bad there isn't some sport where I can take advantage of this unique skill that I have.

""I don't know if I manifested it or what happened, but it wasn't much later that this ended up happening and I'm fired up.""

While no National Hockey League (NHL) players are expected to participate, Amesbury is preparing for stiff competition from players who compete in the American Hockey League (AHL) as well as mid-tier leagues like the ECHL and LNAH.

He said the length of the bouts will guarantee non-stop action.

""An average hockey fight is probably under 20 seconds,"" he said.

""So one minute is a long fight. It's a lot of action. There's going to be a lot of punches being thrown and there's going to be a lot of blood. It's going to be fun, man.""

Ice Wars will debut with an eight-man 'King of the Rink' heavyweight tournament in Edmonton on May 21 that will be streamed on FITE.

New Mexico slams 'Rust' movie firm for 'willful' safety failure,"April 20 - New Mexico on Wednesday fined Rust Movie Productions LLC the maximum amount possible and blasted the company for ""willful"" safety lapses leading to the fatal shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins last year during the filming of Western ""Rust.""


""This tragic incident never would have happened if Rust Movie Productions, LLC had followed national film industry standards for firearm safety,"" Environment Cabinet Secretary James Kenney said in the news release.

Hutchins was killed in October when a revolver that actor and producer Alec Baldwin was rehearsing with during filming in New Mexico fired a live round that hit her and movie director Joel Souza. Souza was wounded but survived.

""While we appreciate OSHA's time and effort in its investigation, we disagree with its findings and plan to appeal,"" Rust Movie Productions spokesman Stefan Friedman said in a statement on Wednesday.

New Mexico's work safety agency administers the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) program.

Its six-month probe found that Rust management, including Line Producer Gabrielle Pickle and Unit Production Manager Row Walters, ignored concerns raised by crew members about firearm and pyrotechnics misfires on set.

3rd Shift Media, a Georgia production company that lists Pickle and Row as employees, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Halls' lawyer did not respond to a request for comment.

The report said Rust management failed to give staff responsible for firearms safety sufficient time to inspect ammunition received to ensure no live rounds were present.


Lawyers for Gutierrez said in a statement that OSHA had found that she was ""not provided adequate time or resources to conduct her job effectively.""

Baldwin has denied responsibility for Hutchins' death and said live rounds should never have been allowed onto the set.

""The Duke,"" out in New York and Los Angeles theaters on Friday, follows 60-year-old Kempton Bunton as he steals Spanish master Francisco de Goya's portrait of the Duke of Wellington from the National Gallery in London in 1961.

The thief sends ransom notes saying he will return the painting on condition that the British government invests more for elderly care.

""I didn't know anything about this story. I was like, really? Did this really happen?"" said Mirren.

""That's what makes it a great story. You couldn't sell it as a fiction,"" added Broadbent.

The filming wrapped right before COVID shutdowns in 2020.

""I remember what filming was like. It was gorgeous,"" Broadbent said. ""It was fun and it was a delight.""

""It was that last moment of freedom and easy access with each other,"" added Mirren.

Director Roger Michell passed away in September at age 65.

The film is part of New York's Angelika Film Center and Sony Pictures Classics 'Bring A Friend Back To The Movies' initiative to encourage audiences to return to the theater.

Cairo's Ramadan street feasts return after coronavirus suspension,"CAIRO, April 19 (Reuters) - Communal meals in which hundreds of people pack around long tables to break their fast during the holy month of Ramadan have returned to Egypt's streets after being widely suspended for the past two years due to COVID-19 restrictions.

In the working-class Cairo neighbourhood of Matariya, residents sat back-to-back along two tables running down a narrow street festooned with balloons, bunting and banners as they enjoyed a meal of barbecued meat, rice and pickles.

Evening street meals are organised by charities for the poor, while others, like the one in Matariya, are run by local communities which pool food donations.

""The Ramadan spirit is back,"" said Haitham Adel, an organiser of the Matariya meal. ""People are back to eating together without being worried.""

Ahmed al-Bardisi, the organiser of a daily charity meal in Giza, across the Nile from central Cairo, said job losses during the coronavirus pandemic had limited food donations.

Though many Egyptians are struggling with accelerating inflation, he said such donations had recovered this year.

Egypt has been hit by successive waves of COVID-19 infections and imposed a nighttime curfew that coincided with Ramadan in 2020. Most restrictions have now been lifted.

Congo nun overcomes blackouts with homemade hydroelectric plant,"MITI, Democratic Republic of Congo, April 20 (Reuters) - Sister Alphonsine Ciza spends most of her day in gum boots, white veil tucked under a builder's hat, manning the micro hydroelectric plant she built to overcome daily electricity cuts in her town of Miti in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.

She works around the clock with a team of nuns and engineers, greasing machinery and checking the dials of a generator that is fed from a nearby reservoir and lights up a convent, church, two schools and a clinic free of charge.

Without the plant, residents would only have electricity two or three days a week for a few hours.

""We sisters... cannot function this way because we have to provide a lot of services,"" said Ciza, 55, a portable voltage meter slung around her neck in the town of about 300,000 inhabitants near the border with Rwanda.

Blackouts are a daily disruption in the Congo, a vast central African country of around 90 million people that sources most of its electricity from a run-down and mismanaged hydropower system.

The government has worked with foreign partners in an effort to increase the capacity of the mineral-rich nation's ailing grid. Critics say the new projects focus too much on powering mines and exporting electricity to neighbouring countries.

Despite millions of dollars in donor funding, only around 20% of the population has access to electricity, according to the World Bank.

Fed up with relying on candlelight and costly fuel-powered generators, Ciza started raising money in 2015 to build the hydropower plant.

She picked up skills as a young nun, repairing electrical faults around the convent, which convinced superiors to send her to study mechanical engineering.

It took Ciza's convent three years to gather the required $297,000 and build the plant, which generates between 0.05 and 0.1 MW.

Thanks to Ciza's efforts, students at Miti's Maendeleo secondary school can now learn computer skills from screens rather than from books.

""Previously, power often only came on at night, when children were no longer in school,"" said headmistress Mweze Nsimire Gilberte.

""Having our own turbine has been a great relief.""

Paragliders return to Ghana's skies for Easter festival,"KWAHU-ATIBIE, Ghana, April 19 (Reuters) - Every Easter weekend, thousands of people from around the world flock to the quiet Ghanaian towns of Kwahu and Atibie for a paragliding festival and Easter carnival that residents hope may establish the West African nation as a hub for extreme sports.

This year marked the festival's return to its annual schedule after the COVID-19 pandemic forced organisers to postpone the last two years' events.

Around 400 people registered for tandem flights with professional pilots, rivalling some of the festival's most popular years, according to Tourist Board figures. Dozens brought their own equipment to fly solo.

Participants hungry for adrenaline strapped into their harnesses and ran off a ridge atop Ghana's second tallest mountain. As their kites caught wind, pilots and passengers alike were launched into the sky.

Having acquired his tandem certification during the pandemic, he is now the only Ghanaian at the festival certified to carry others into the clouds.

""People think it's not a safe sport, or have a mentality like it's only for white people,"" he said after touching down. ""But all those people who say that, they've never been here.""

Quaye was one of only four Ghanaian paragliders to fly solo at this year's festival, two of whom live outside Ghana. But the scene is growing, thanks in part to what Quaye said is the sport's innate quality for fostering community.

Stephen Owusu Asamoah, a Ghanaian living in the United States, returned to his home town of Kwahu - around 150 km (90 miles) north of the capital Accra - with his own kite and gear earlier this month, eager to participate in the festival after learning to fly last year.

""When you see people like you doing what you want to do, it lets you know that you can also get into it,"" he said. ""I feel like this is going to really motivate a lot of people.""

Bidens kick off first Easter Egg Roll in two years,"WASHINGTON, April 18 (Reuters) - After a pandemic hiatus, President Joe Biden, first lady Jill Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris launched the first White House Easter Egg Roll in two years on Monday, resuming an annual tradition for children that dates back to 1878.

""Ready, set, go!"" Biden shouted and blew a whistle to begin the festivities, in which children race to roll pastel-colored eggs down a portion of the South Lawn using long-handled spoons.

A light rain did nothing to put a damper on an event in which 30,000 children and adults were participating. Many top administration officials were on hand for the egg roll, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken and White House press secretary Jen Psaki and their children.

""My job is to keep it from raining for another two minutes,"" Biden said in remarks from the White House balcony, standing alongside Mrs. Biden and two people wearing Easter Bunny costumes.

While Harris blew a whistle to launch a wave of egg rollers, the Bidens went to another a section of the lawn to read a children's book, “Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?” They were soon joined by NBC's ""Tonight Show"" host Jimmy Fallon, who read aloud his children's book, ""Nana Loves You More.""

The theme of the event was ""egg-ucation,"" and the South Lawn was set up with an education theme. Jill Biden is a community college professor.

The egg roll event is a tradition begun by then-President Rutherford B. Hayes in 1878. The coronavirus pandemic forced cancellation of the event in 2020 and 2021.

Box Office: 'Fantastic Beasts 3' Opens to Franchise-Low $43 Million,"LOS ANGELES, April 17 (Variety.com) - ""Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore,"" the third chapter in the ""Harry Potter"" spinoff series, collected a muted $43 million in its domestic box office debut.

In pandemic times, those ticket sales were enough to lead this weekend's box office charts and land one of the biggest North American openings in 2022. But it's also a sign that magic is in short supply for J.K. Rowling's lucrative and ever-expanding Wizarding World. Dinged by mixed reviews and growing apathy for prequel series star Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) and company, ""The Secrets of Dumbledore"" stands as the worst start for a ""Harry Potter""-adjacent movie. (Its predecessors 2016's ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,"" launched to $74 million in North America, while the 2018 follow-up ""The Crimes of Grindelwald"" bowed to $62 million.)

The diminishing enthusiasm for ""Fantastic Beasts"" is problematic because witchcraft and wizardry does not come cheap. Warner Bros. shelled out $200 million to produce ""The Secrets of Dumbledore,"" and the studio spent tens of millions more to promote the film to audiences across the globe. Like its predecessors, ""The Secrets of Dumbledore"" will be reliant on the international box office to make money in its theatrical run. The first two ""Fantastic Beasts"" installments -- which ended with $814 million globally and $650 million globally, respectively -- made nearly 75% of revenues from foreign sales.

""Fantastic Beasts 3,"" too, has been a bigger draw to overseas audiences. Since the film touched down in several foreign markets last weekend, ""The Secrets of Dumbledore"" has grossed $193 million globally to date. But the persistence of COVID-19 has cut into the box office in China, where 50% of movie theaters are closed, while Russia's invasion of Ukraine has meant that country is not granted access to Hollywood's films. Those limitations have been difficult for all blockbusters. Since the pandemic began in 2020, only five Hollywood movies have generated at least $500 million at the global box office.

""Harry Potter"" veteran David Yates directed the third chapter in the prequel series, which follows the beloved Hogwarts professor Albus Dumbledore (portrayed by Jude Law). But he's only one of a couple Dumbledores with ""secrets,"" as referenced in the movie's title. In ""Fantastic Beasts 3,"" which was co-written by Rowling and another ""Potter"" alum Steve Kloves, a young(er) Albus and Scamander, a notable magizoologist, team up to thwart the dark wizard Gellert Grindelwald (Madds Mikkelson, replacing Johnny Depp) from igniting a wizarding world war. The cast also includes Ezra Miller, Dan Fogler, Alison Sudol, Callum Turner and Jessica Williams.

Variety's Peter Debruge called the film a ""vastly improved sequel,"" which isn't saying much because fans were not particularly receptive to the last entry. The prequel saga, which predates the adventures of Harry, Ron and Hermione, is intended to be a five-film franchise, but executives at Warner Bros. are waiting to see how ""The Secrets of Dumbledore"" is received by audiences before giving films four and five the greenlight. ""Fantastic Beasts 3"" secured a ""B+"" CinemaScore, the same grade as its predecessor. ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" landed higher marks, an ""A-"" score, from moviegoers.

Off-screen, ""Fantastic Beasts"" has been a controversy magnet. On top of declining box office ticket sales, the series has been subject to blowback over Rowling's controversial views on sex and gender identity, as well as the domestic abuse allegations that forced Depp out of the franchise. And Miller, who has a key role in the latest film, was recently arrested for disorderly conduct and harassment, though the temporary restraining order against the actor has been newly dropped. Though moviegoers may not be aware of all the scandals plaguing ""Fantastic Beasts,"" internally at Warner Bros. it has become a headache, one that has become less and less pleasant to endure because the series isn't exactly minting money in its theatrical run. The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, however, is much more than a film franchise. The fantastical universe has lent itself to profitable theme parks, live events, a Broadway play, as well as consumer products riches and success on home entertainment.

This weekend's other major release, Sony's R-rated faith-based drama ""Father Stu,"" flopped in its domestic debut, earning only $5 million from 2,705 North American theaters. The film, which sunk to fifth place, has earned $8 million since opening on Wednesday. Mark Wahlberg, who stars in the film with Mel Gibson, produced ""Father Stu"" and used his own money when COVID-19 tacked on extra costs to production.

Rosalind Ross, Gibson's partner, wrote and directed the film, which tells the story of boxer-turned-priest Father Stuart Long and his inspiring journey from self-destruction to redemption. ""Father Stu"" is Gibson's first major studio movie since 2017's ""Daddy's Home 2"" from Paramount Pictures. An Oscar winner for ""Braveheart"" and Academy Award-nominee for ""Hacksaw Ridge,"" Gibson has largely been working on smaller indies and straight-to-streaming action films with Lionsgate and Saban Films in the decade since making headlines for anti-semitic and racist tirades.


Sandra Bullock and Channing Tatum's romantic action-adventure ""The Lost City"" took third place for the second weekend in a row. The movie, also from Paramount Pictures, collected $6.5 million in its fourth weekend in theaters, bringing its domestic tally to $78.5 million.

A24's genre-overload ""Everything Everywhere All At Once"" enjoyed another impressive run, moving up to fourth place with $6.1 million from 2,220 screens. Directed by Dan Kwan and Daniel Scheinert and starring Michelle Yeoh in a multiverse action-adventure-comedy-fantasy-sci-fi mashup, has earned $17.6 million so far.

UK rock band The Who back on tour after COVID cancellations,"Roger Daltrey (L) and Pete Townshend of The Who perform at Desert Trip music festival at Empire Polo Club in Indio, California U.S., October 9, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni

NEW YORK, April 14 (Reuters) - After costly pandemic cancellations, British rock band The Who is back on the road again with THE WHO HITS BACK! tour.

""We're just hitting back at COVID because it stopped us in our tracks. We were, we were going to call it, 'Where Were We?'"" lead singer Roger Daltrey said ahead of the tour starting next week.

Daltrey and Pete Townshend, the band's principal songwriter famed for thrashing his guitar on stage, are the only surviving original members of the group which emerged in 1960s London with drummer Keith Moon and bass player John Entwistle.

The Who has sold more than 100 million records worldwide, with the rock opera ""Tommy"" and hits like ""Won't Get Fooled Again"" and ""I Can See For Miles.""


The Who's tours have become a lot more complicated, Daltrey said. ""We were, we were four guys with eight amplifiers, a drum kit and a sound system. That was it. We turn up in a U-Haul truck and three roadies would suit us for the night.""

Daltrey refuses to worry about COVID affecting the tour, he said at his England countryside home. ""We're just living our lives. And if you get it and die, you get it and die, you know?""

The rock legend, who has worked with many of the world's top bands, named Mick Jagger as his top rock band frontman followed jointly by Freddie Mercury and Elton John, Bruce Springsteen and David Bowie.

While the band has no plans to stop touring, the time will come, Daltrey acknowledged.

""I've always said about this business. You don't give it up, it gives you up. I will open my mouth and it won't come out like it should. And I will go, that's it, can't do it anymore.""

Zombies will once again kick off Cannes Film Festival,"Cannes Film festival General Delegate Thierry Fremaux and Cannes Film festival President Pierre Lescure talk during the presentation of the official selection of the 75th Cannes International Film Festival in Paris, France, April 14, 2022. REUTERS/Sarah Meyssonnier

PARIS, April 14 (Reuters) - The Cannes Film Festival will open on its 75th anniversary next month with the screening of a film about zombies,""Z (Comme Z)"" by Michel Hazanavicius, director of award-winning film ""The Artist.""

""It's a zombie comedy that evokes passion for cinema,"" festival director Thierry Fremaux told a news conference on Thursday, recalling that the 2019 event had kicked off with a film from Jim Jarmusch on the same theme.

The festival runs from May 17-28 and will feature heavy-hitters including Tom Cruise’s ""Top Gun"" sequel and an Elvis biopic by Baz Luhrmann starring Austin Butler and Tom Hanks.

Organizers have said the competition will include James Gray's ""Armageddon Time,"" a drama with Anne Hathaway, Jeremy Strong and Anthony Hopkins and a screening of ""Three Thousand Years of Longing"" by George Miller, with a cast including Idris Elba and Tilda Swinton.

The festival, which announced in March it would ban official Russian delegations from the event unless the conflict in Ukraine ends, will feature ""Tchaikovski’s Wife"" by exiled Russian director Kirill Serebrennikov, who has been outspoken about the war.

In the category of first time projects, the festival will feature a debut film from Maksim Nakonechnyi, shot recently in Ukraine. Entitled ""Butterfly Vision,"" it traces the story of a young Ukrainian woman who returns to her country after being captured then released in a prisoner swap.

Fremaux signalled an openness to platforms like Netflix, while acknowledging he still had to try to convince those who disagreed with him.

""It's clear we have to acknowledge the existence of these new types of distribution and production, I think we need to maintain a dialogue with them,"" he said.

Fremaux drew criticism from the French movie theatre industry in 2017 by allowing Netflix films - seen as a threat to the industry because they are streamed to subscribers rather than shown in cinemas - into the Cannes competition.

Meanwhile, movie theatres around the world continue to face the challenge of bringing back audiences.

""I hope the Cannes Film Festival will serve as a spark for the return of audiences to the movies, but for the moment there is not a big return and some countries are suffering from a loss of interest,"" he said.
