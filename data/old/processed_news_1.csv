Live Updates: Zelensky Says U.S. Secretary of State Will Visit Kyiv; Missiles Hit Odesa,"A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March. The war in Ukraine has stoked fears in Moldova of renewed pressures from Russia.

CHISINAU, Moldova — Before war erupted next door, Moldovans had big plans for their country.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine put Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of Europe’s poorest nations, in an extremely vulnerable situation, threatening its economic development, straining its society with waves of refugees and evoking existential fears of yet another Russian occupation.

The war jitters are also adding another chapter to Moldova’s long and increasingly desperate effort to untangle itself from Moscow’s clutches. In pursuit of that, it recently applied to join the European Union, but the prospect of gaining admission anytime soon is remote.

“We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” said Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, in an interview.

Moldovans’ fears swelled anew on Friday, when a Russian general said his country’s military now plans to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine. That would establish a land bridge from Russia in the east to Transnistria, a heavily armed, breakaway region in Moldova’s east — bordering Ukraine — that is controlled by Russia.

Whether Russia has the wherewithal to swallow up such a large stretch of Ukrainian territory is debatable, especially in view of the enormous losses its military suffered in the battle for Kyiv. But whether real or just an effort to stir up trouble in the region, the Moldovans are taking the general’s threat seriously.

The Moldovan government has long been nervous about Transnistria, a thin sliver of territory that is controlled by at least 12,000 separatists and Russian troops. Since the war erupted, the Moldovan and Ukrainian militaries have faced the extra concern of whether the Transnistrians were going to jump into the battle and start attacking Ukraine from the west. So far, that has not happened.

Tucked between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is tiny — with less than three million people — and for centuries has been torn between greater powers: first the Ottomans and Russia, and now Europe and Russia. The theme, clearly, is Russia, and Russia does not want to let it go.

Moscow exerts a stranglehold over nearly 100 percent of Moldova’s energy supply. And the Kremlin is constantly trying to stir up Moldova’s many Russian speakers who are susceptible to its propaganda, especially in Transnistria.

That is what seemed to have happened on Friday, when, according to the Russian news media, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said, “Russian control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are cases of Russian-speaking people being oppressed.”

The Moldovan government immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about the general’s statement, saying it was “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”

For Ms. Sandu, 49, the country’s first female president, it was another hurdle along a dangerous pathway she has been trying to navigate since the crisis began.

Moldova has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and barred Moldovans from sticking pro-Russia symbols on their cars. At the same time, the country did not fully join the European Union’s sanctions on Russia, for fear of being cut off from Russian gas.

“No one said it was going to be easy,” Ms. Sandu, 49, said from her office on Stefan cel Mare, the grand boulevard in the capital, Chisinau, that cuts past a patchwork of hulking, Soviet-style office buildings. “But no one said it was going to be this hard.”

The war has been hard not only on her but on most everyone here. Before the hostilities started, Adrian Trofim, whose family owns a 19th-century countryside winery and resort, thought that he was finally catching a break after two years of struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. He was adding a wing to the hotel, setting up a spa focused on wine-based treatments and gearing up to produce a sparkling wine.

But now his operations have fallen into peril. Brandy worth a quarter of a million dollars that he needs to ship to Belarus has been blocked in his warehouses. His regular Ukrainian customers have no way of paying him, costing him several more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he cannot ship his chardonnays to China, one of his new markets, because the port in Odesa, Ukraine, that he uses for exports shut down as soon as the first bombs fell in February.

“I don’t know what to do,” said Mr. Trofim, who may soon have to lay off almost half of his staff. “Everything is frozen until we understand how to live with this situation.”

It could be a while. When the war began in Ukraine, residents of Chisinau said they were awakened by the sounds of not-so-far-off explosions. Then Ukrainian refugees started streaming in — more than 400,000 have arrived, Moldovan officials have said — putting a severe strain on public services in a country where the average annual income is less than $6,000.

Prices for basic goods then shot up as supply chains were disrupted. And business owners had to persuade their employees, terrified that the war might cross into Moldova, not to flee the country, following the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who moved abroad in the past decade.

“We were already considered a high risk,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moldova. “We had just started convincing investors to take a shot on us. Now everyone has backed out.”

It is not all bad news. Some Ukrainian companies are considering moving to Moldova, in search of a safer environment. And with all of the foreign dignitaries (and news crews) swooping in, its international profile has received a lift, leading the government last month to rebrand Moldova as “a small country with a big heart.”

Many Russians discovered that big heart long ago. During Soviet times, retired officers flocked to Moldova, drawn by the scenery, good food and sunshine. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the country was run by pro-Russian elites, who kept strong links with Moscow, especially regarding energy.

Moldova receives all its gas from companies controlled by Russia. And even though Moldovan leaders have talked a big game about weaning the country off Russian gas and getting energy from other countries like Azerbaijan, Turkey and Romania, none of those, at the moment, could come close to what Russia provides.

And so Russia continues to use its sway over gas prices to push Moldova around. Russia has intimated, for instance, that it would lower prices if Moldova agreed to make concessions on Transnistria, which Moldova has refused.

Moldova’s twin problems, of energy and Transnistria, are interconnected. In the Soviet era, Moldova’s biggest power plant, and its two biggest gas-pumping stations, were built in Transnistria.

“If you look at the map, it doesn’t make sense,” said Victor Parlicov, an energy analyst and a former government official. “It was built this way in case Moldova would try to pursue its own path.”

Transnistria has its own flag, complete with a Soviet-style hammer and sickle, and a separate identity from the rest of Moldova. Its roots go back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union carved out a small republic in the same area, before incorporating parts of it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during World War II.” Mr. Parlicov said that this fit a pattern of the Soviet authorities reshaping the borders of republics against historical realities, which created the potential for conflict.

Transnistria’s situation mirrors that of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists rebelled after the anti-Russian 2014 rebellion, setting off a chain of events that led to war. Transnistria also complicates Moldova’s aspirations to join the European Union.

“We’d be happy to be part of the E.U.,” said Serghei Diaconu, the deputy interior minister. But, he added, half-jokingly, Transnistria was “a big pain” that could discourage the E.U. from accepting Moldova.

Joining NATO would be an even taller order. Neutrality is enshrined in Moldova’s constitution, a holdover from the early 1990s, when it tried to stand on its own without antagonizing Russia. Now, Moldova’s leaders are questioning the wisdom of that approach.

“If you ask me whether neutrality is going to keep us safe, I don’t know,” said Ms. Sandu, the president. “It did not help over the last three decades to convince Russia to take its troops out of the country.”

The geopolitical tightrope the country is forced to walk, in the eyes of many Moldovans, means its future is intertwined with Russia’s. Mr. Trofim, the winemaker, for one, said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

As he looked at the winery’s vast, neat gardens, empty but for a few visitors, he said that he was appalled by what Russia had done in Ukraine, but that he could not condemn anyone forever.

“I cannot say I will never do business with Russia,” Mr. Trofim said. “It is a matter of the well-being of my company.”","Anton Troianovski, Cassandra Vinograd, Marc Santora, Victoria Kim, Alexandra Petri, Andrea Kannapell, Farnaz Fassihi, Ivan Nechepurenko",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/23/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/russia-opens-a-criminal-case-accusing-a-pro-democracy-activist-of-spreading-false-information-about-the-war,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/world/22ukraine-blog-kara-murza/22ukraine-blog-kara-murza-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes,"A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March.

Mask Ruling Underscores Deep Split in Attitudes,"Wearing masks during the pandemic has long been a divisive issue in the United States. And now that a federal judge has tossed out the mask mandate for planes and public transportation, rules in some places have been thrown into chaos. Many were lifted, and a few reimposed.

But even as the changes cause some confusion, Americans’ attitudes toward the restrictions have wavered little in recent months and, in fact, are still impassioned. Some who are already in the habit of masking in public and see Covid-19 cases rising again in parts of the country are angry at losing the protection they have relied on. Others are elated by the release from those irritating bands behind their ears.

“Ecstatic” was the way Patrick McDonnell, a 30-year-old architect from Brooklyn, described his feelings, adding, “Enough is enough.” Mr. McDonnell said he found wearing a mask “annoying” and “uncomfortable” and has already stopped masking on the New York City subway, even though face coverings are still required on mass transit in the city.

“Adults should be able to make their own decisions regarding the risks they’re willing to take,” Mr. McDonnell said. As for masking for the sake of fellow riders who are older or in poor health, he said that vaccines and treatments are now available for Covid-19, and he should no longer have to alter his behavior to accommodate others.","Roni Caryn Rabin, Emily Erdos",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/mask-mandate-transportation-response.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/science/23VIRUS-VOICES-MASKS1/23VIRUS-VOICES-MASKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes,"Wearing masks during the pandemic has long been a divisive issue in the United States.

"A ‘Catalyst’ From the Start, Miguel Cabrera Reaches 3,000 Hits","The very best players make a manager want to change the rules.

Atlanta Falcons player Grady Jarrett was denied entry to an Atlanta restaurant earlier this week.

Jarrett called out Le Bilboquet in a now-deleted Instagram post, local news reported.

""You ever see someone working [out] in a full Gucci suit?"" he told WXIA-TV.

An NFL player says he was denied entry into an Atlanta restaurant earlier this week due to his attire, according to reports.

Atlanta Falcons defensive end Grady Jarrett claimed that Le Bilboquet, a French restaurant located in Buckhead, turned him away on Wednesday in a now-deleted Instagram post, WSB-TV reported.

According to the report, the football player was donning a casual Gucci tracksuit worth thousand of dollars and a tennis chain when the incident happened.

The outlet noted that in his post Jarrett said other people inside the establishment were dressed in T-shirts and sweatsuits. A photo of Jarrett's outfit was shared on Twitter by WSB-TV reporter Audrey Washington.

""It wasn't a good feeling,"" Jarrett told the outlet.

According to Le Bilboquet's policies, athletic and beach attire, sweatpants, baseball caps, cut denim, and flip flops are prohibited.

""You ever see someone working [out] in a full Gucci suit?"" Jarett said, per WXIA-TV. ""I'm an athlete.""

In a statement to CBS46, the restaurant stood by its dress code policy but apologized to guests they had previously turned away. According to reports, former Atlanta Hawks player Dominque Wilkins was denied entry last year.

""Our dress code (which clearly states that athletic wear is not allowed) is posted at our door, online and reiterated by our reservation team. Last spring, we relaxed our dress code to accommodate Atlanta's more casual environment and required all staff members to undergo extensive sensitivity training,"" the statement said, per the outlet.

The statement continued: ""We never want to turn away guests, but we must treat all guests equally by providing a standard for everyone who wishes to dine with us. Our apologies to anyone who has ever been turned away.""

Jarrett told WXIA-TV he understands that places have dress codes; however, ""for my suit to be classified as athletic wear under their discretion, I just didn't think that was really fitting or correct.""

Last week, former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that she was denied service at The Captial Grille at Perimeter Mall in Georgia because she was wearing leggings, which she called ""odd.""

""Rules are the rules, just wonder if the woman who came in immediately after me, who I did not see come back out, was also denied service,"" Bottoms tweeted last Friday.

"Falcons star, former mayor turned away from popular restaurants over dress code","An Atlanta Falcons star is calling out a well-known Buckhead restaurant after he says he was refused service because of the way he was dressed.

Linebacker Grady Jarrett said he was trying to have dinner at Le Bilboquet when a manager approached him and told him he wasn’t dressed properly.

Jarrett posted about the incident on his Instagram account over the weekend.

“Not sure if I know how my dress is offensive, maybe it’s the Gucci suit, the Bussdown AP Offshore, the iced double tennis chain w an Ankh and the fact that I pulled up in my 500k RR and they felt I wasn’t fit to bless their restaurant for dinner.. I guess the other people rocking Nike sweat suits and t shirts that were already seated (as you can see in the background of the picture) n enjoying dinner were no problem.. unfortunate but I’m not going for it.. This not even my style I’m a cool guy you should ask around.. Do better @lebilboquetatlanta,” Jarrett wrote on Instagram.

Channel 2′s Audrey Washington was in Buckhead Thursday, where Jarrett told her that he was hurt and embarrassed to be turned away. Jarrett said he was out with his girlfriend when they stopped at the restaurant for lunch.

He said before they could even order, the manger walked up.

“He came up to me and looked me up and down,” Jarrett said.

Jarrett said he was wearing a Gucci track suit worth thousands of dollars -- but that didn’t stop the manager from telling him he was not dressed according to the restaurant’s dress code and asking him to leave.

“It wasn’t a good feeling,” Jarrett said.

Jarrett pointed out that other people in the background of his photo were also wearing casual clothing.

“And the people inside the restaurant as well, but I didn’t want to invade their privacy and take pictures of them,” Jarrett said.

Martin Theis manages the restaurant. He said he was not there when Jarrett was denied service, but said all patrons are asked to follow the dress code.

“We never like upsetting people with the dress code, but it’s something that we do need to maintain,” Theis said.

The dress code reads in part that sweatpants and athletic attire are not allowed.

Last year, a similar incident happened at the same restaurant when a waiter denied basketball legend Dominique Wilkins service because he was wearing a sweatsuit.

Washington asked Jarrett if he thinks the dress code should be abolished all together.

“I don’t think it should go away,” Jarrett said. “I think consistency is the most important thing. Don’t tell me not to do something and you have other people enjoying themselves doing the same thing.”

Jarrett said he wore a similar sweatsuit to the same restaurant last week and was not asked to leave.

The restaurant issued a statement to Channel 2 Action News Thursday night, saying:

“At Le Bilboquet, we value each and every patron and their unique style. However, we have a dress code to maintain a certain standard. Our dress code (which clearly states that athletic wear is not allowed) is posted at our door, online and reiterated by our reservation team. Last spring, we relaxed our dress code to accommodate Atlanta’s more casual environment and required all staff members to undergo extensive sensitivity training. We never want to turn away guests, but we must treat all guests equally by providing a standard for everyone who wishes to dine with us. Our apologies to anyone who has ever been turned away.”

Le Bilboquet isn’t the only restaurant in Atlanta that has been criticized for its dress code enforcement. Former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was denied service at the Capitol Grille Saturday because of her leggings.

“Odd that a restaurant in a mall parking lot turns away customers in “mall” attire. Asked if I could sit in the bar area and was told, “No.” Rules are the rules, just wonder if the woman who came in immediately after me, who I did not see come back out, was also denied service,” Bottoms tweeted.

Jarrett is also not the only Atlanta athlete who has spoken out against Le Bilboquet.

NBA Hall of Famer and Hawks legend Dominique Wilkins posted last year a photo on Twitter after the restaurant denied him service. Wilkins believed he was turned away due to the color of his skin.

The restaurant posted a statement about their dress code but later issued an apology to Wilkins.

“We want to apologize to Mr. Wilkins for his experience at our restaurant and also for any confusion our dress code may have caused. We in no way intended for him to feel unwanted, and welcome an open dialogue with him. Our upscale dining experience and our brand’s culture is made up of multiple elements, which include our music, our food and our patrons’ attire. We continue to strive to manifest our dining experience in a way that is exciting and most importantly, inclusive.”

Judge dismisses lawsuit against Tiger Woods' restaurant in death of bartender in crash,"JUPITER — A Palm Beach County judge has thrown out a lawsuit accusing a Jupiter restaurant owned by golfing great Tiger Woods of causing the 2018 alcohol-fueled death of a 24-year-old bartender.

In a decision that is being challenged by a lawyer for the grieving parents of Nicholas Immesberger, Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg-Feuer ruled that The Woods Jupiter can’t be held responsible for the single-car rollover crash that claimed the life of the young man who struggled with alcohol.

Evidence showed that Immesberger, like other employees, helped himself to pineapple slices soaked in vodka and alcoholic drinks before leaving the restaurant to head home, she wrote.

“There is no evidence that Immesberger paid The Woods, or was asked to pay, for any of the alcoholic beverages he consumed on Dec. 10, 2018,” Schosberg-Feuer said in the 15-page ruling.

Tiger Woods is an investor in a restaurant called The Woods at Harbourside in Jupiter.

Circuit judge appointed: Jupiter attorney Darren Shull named Palm Beach County's newest circuit court judge

Citing a series of Florida Supreme Court decisions, she said restaurants and bars can be held liable for a patron’s death only if they “knowingly” serve a person who is “habitually addicted” to alcohol or is a minor.

Since Immesberger wasn’t served or what Schosberger-Feuer called “vended,” the restaurant didn’t run afoul of state law, she concluded.

Attorney Barry Postman, who represents the popular Harbourside Place restaurant, applauded the ruling that was issued in March.

“We’re very pleased that the judge appropriately applied the law and found that Mr. Immesberger’s parents didn’t have a basis to bring a claim against The Woods,” he said.

Initially, both Woods and his girlfriend, Erica Herman, who managed the sprawling restaurant near the Intracoastal Waterway, were named in the lawsuit. They were dropped when no evidence surfaced that they were at the eatery on the day of the fatal crash.

Story continues

A family photo of Nicholas Immesberger, who was killed in a car crash, shown at a press conference Tuesday, May 14, 2019, where the family announced they are suing Tiger Woods, his restaurant The Woods, and his girlfriend Erica Herman. They accuse the Jupiter restaurant of serving him excessive amounts of alcohol. Herman is the general manager of The Woods, where Immesberger was employed as a bartender.

Postman voiced confidence that Schosberg-Feuer’s decision would be upheld on appeal. But an attorney for Immesberger’s parents, Mary Katherine Belowsky and Scott Duchene, disagreed.

“She ruled that if you give away free alcohol, you can’t be held liable under Florida’s Dram Shop law,” attorney Spencer Kuvin said. “I believe she is dead wrong.”

Kuvin has already appealed Schosberg-Feuer’s decision. But before the 4th District Court of Appeal reviews it, Schosberg-Feuer agreed to give the case another look.

At a hearing scheduled for June 24, she agreed to consider Kuvin’s claims that she got it wrong.

Tiger Woods, seen here celebrating his win at the 2019 Masters Tournament in August, Georgia, is an investor in the restaurant bearing his name at Harbourside Place in Jupiter.

In court papers, Kuvin said Schosberg-Feuer strayed far from past court decisions and common sense.

“No court has conclusively held that 'vendors' … are absolved from liability because (they) did not 'sell' or 'take money' from the 'habitual drunkard,’ "" Kuvin wrote. ""If this were to be the case, then vendors (bars, taverns, or restaurants) could freely hand out or pour alcohol free of charge with no consequences to its actions.""

Postman countered that Kuvin is misinterpreting both the law and Schosberg-Feuer’s ruling. The Woods didn’t ""knowingly serve” Immesberger, he wrote. Therefore, it can’t be held responsible for his death.

But, Kuvin said, at least one fellow employee said Immesberger was drunk when he left the restaurant.

In a sworn statement, server Jenna Brodeur said when she gave Immesberger a hug, ""I could smell the booze and he was sweaty.”

Managers, who knew the young man attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, should have stopped him from getting into his grandfather's 1999 Chevy Corvette and driving off, Kuvin argued.

But, Postman said, three other employees said they didn’t think Immesberger was intoxicated. Brodeur also said she never saw anyone serve Immesberger and didn’t know he was an alcoholic.

Postman also objected to Kuvin’s claims that Brodeur offers new evidence of wrongdoing. Kuvin has known about Brodeur since shortly after the suit was filed in 2019.

Further, he claimed, rather than shore up Kuvin's claims, Brodeur's statements underscore Schosberg-Feuer’s conclusion that the restaurant is blameless.

All sides agree that the case is incredibly tragic. Immesberger was raised by his mother, who didn’t tell him about his father until he was in his teens, Kuvin said. As he and his father were building a relationship, his younger half-brother committed suicide. His personal struggles spurred him to seek comfort in alcohol, he said.

“Nick needed help. He didn’t need encouragement for drinking,” Kuvin said.

Toxicology tests conducted after Immesberger’s death showed he had had a blood-alcohol level of 0.256 – more than three times the 0.08 percent mark at which Florida drivers are presumed to be impaired. His blood also showed traces of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Woods, who was arrested on drunken driving charges after a single-vehicle crash in Jupiter in 2017 and entered a court diversion program, talked about Immesberger's death shortly after the suit was filed.

Speaking to reporters before playing in the PGA Championship golf tournament on Long Island, New York, Woods said he and the restaurant staff were devastated.

“It was a terrible night, terrible ending,” he said. “We feel bad for him and his entire family. It's very sad.""

In a decision that is being challenged by a lawyer for the grieving parents of Nicholas Immesberger, Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg-Feuer ruled that The Woods Jupiter can’t be held responsible for the single-car rollover crash that claimed the life of the young man who struggled with alcohol. Evidence showed that Immesberger, like other employees, helped himself to pineapple slices soaked in vodka and alcoholic drinks before leaving the restaurant to head home, she wrote.

"Yankees, Jacoby Ellsbury quietly settled 2019 grievance 'at least a year ago': report","Jacoby Ellsbury swinging in pinstripes Yankees

Back in 2019, the Yankees filed a grievance against former outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, looking to recoup some of the money the team owed him as part of his seven-year, $153 million contract.

According to a report from the New York Post, the Yankees and Ellsbury quietly settled that grievance “at least a year ago” to avoid a hearing.

The grievance was filed when the team released the oft-injured outfielder in November 2019, when he still had $21 million and one year remaining on the contract, along with a $5 million buyout, that the team converted to non-guaranteed money. The MLBPA subsequently filed a grievance on Ellsbury’s behalf to make the team pay the remaining money.

The Yankees claimed that Ellsbury used an outside facility, without the team’s permission, to rehab during 2018 and 2019. Ellsbury missed both seasons due to a variety of injuries, starting with an oblique strain before a lower-back issue popped up. The former Boston Red Sox outfielder then had surgery for a torn labrum that ended any chance of playing in 2019.

In all, Ellsbury played 520 games over the span of four seasons with the Yankees, slashing .264/.330/.386 with 39 home runs, 198 RBI and 273 runs scored.",Alex Smith,https://sports.yahoo.com/yankees-jacoby-ellsbury-quietly-settled-022108785.html,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jow5GN5CmFbYBg5UCljdQA--~B/aD0yNTA7dz00NDQ7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sny_articles_235/f1ce8e21d1a9a1d53fd8e0c03cbd7e00,Yahoo,"Jacoby Ellsbury swinging in pinstripes Yankees

Scottie Barnes just barely beats Evan Mobley for Rookie of the Year award,"In the closest Rookie of the Year award vote in nearly two decades, Toronto Raptors standout Scottie Barnes came out on top. Barnes narrowly defeated Cleveland Cavaliers rookie Evan Mobley, winning the 2021-22 NBA Rookie of the Years award Saturday.

Barnes, 20, also beat out Cade Cunningham of the Detroit Pistons for the award. The three players were named finalists for the Rookie of the Year award Sunday.

Barnes received 48 first-place votes, helping him net a total of 378 points. Mobley finished just 15 points behind Barnes, making it the closest Rookie of the Year vote in this voting format.

The 15-point difference between the NBA Rookie of the Year winner (Scottie Barnes) and the second-place finisher (Evan Mobley) is the smallest margin since the current voting format began 19 years ago.

"Miguel Cabrera becomes 33rd MLB player to enter 3,000 hit club","Miguel Cabrera has officially entered one of MLB's most exclusive clubs.

The Detroit Tigers first baseman recorded the 3,000th hit of his career on Saturday at Detroit's Comerica Park, making him the 33rd player in MLB history to reach a milestone widely considered to be an automatic ticket to Cooperstown.

Cabrera picked up the milestone hit in his first at-bat of the game. On the third pitch of Cabrera's at-bat against Colorado Rockies starter Antonio Senzatela, Cabrera sent a single through the right side of the infield for his 3,000th hit.

Cabrera entered the 2022 season needing only 13 hits to reach 3,000, making it a simple matter of ""when."" Only two other players have registered their 3,000th hit in a Tigers uniform and they're both Detroit legends: Ty Cobb and Al Kaline. He is also the first Venezuelan player to enter the club.

Cabrera also entered the 500-homer club last August, making him only the seventh player in MLB history to enter both clubs. The other six: Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro, Eddie Murray, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.

All of this adds up to a very easy Hall of Fame case for a player who spent years as one of the big leagues' most feared sluggers.

Miguel Cabrera has a slam-dunk Hall of Fame case

Cabrera's MLB career goes all the way back to 2003, when he was a 20-year-old rookie thrust into the Florida Marlins' World Series run. Cabrera signed with the Marlins as an international free agent out of Venezuela in 1999 and quickly established himself as a top prospect.

Scouting reports at the time don't hail Cabrera as a defensive standout in the infield or a speedster on the bases, but they loved his ability to make contact, his bat speed and his work ethic. All of that would turn out to be prescient, starting with a rookie season that saw him produce at an above-average clip as one of the majors' youngest players and deliver some big hits in the 2003 World Series against the New York Yankees.

Story continues

Cabrera would only get better from there, notching back-to-back Silver Sluggers at third base in the third and fourth years of his career while becoming a perennial MVP candidate. His Florida career came to an end in 2007, when the ever-belt-tightening Marlins traded him to the Tigers for a bounty of prospects, none of whom would come close to matching the slugger's success on the diamond.

Cabrera found even more success in Detroit, notching five Silver Sluggers, four batting titles, two MVP awards and the Triple Crown in 2012. From 2008 to 2016, he hit .330/.412/.578 with 34 homers and 113 RBIs per season. He never got a ring in Detroit, unlike Florida, but he figures to enter Cooperstown in a Tigers hat.

Now playing at 39 years old, Cabrera's skills have taken a bit of a step back. It has been six years since he hit .300 in a season and he only hit .256/.316/.386 with 15 homers in 130 games last season. His value to the Tigers now lies more in the mentorship role, as the team tries to ride its new wave of youth back to contention.

Whether Cabrera, who has one more guaranteed season left on his contract, is around for that potential success remains to be seen, but he doesn't have much left to prove. The only players in the 3,000-hit club who are not in the Hall of Fame are either not currently eligible (e.g. Ichiro Suzuki, Adrian Beltre) or marred by scandal (Pete Rose, Rafael Palmeiro).",,https://sports.yahoo.com/miguel-cabrera-tigers-mlb-enter-3000-hit-club-173135392.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DCVpzPeQPNqjnIIhaxGS4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/575c4020-c10a-11ec-bbff-95972655d0af,Yahoo,"Miguel Cabrera has officially entered one of MLB's most exclusive clubs.

Orioles ace John Means to undergo Tommy John surgery after breakout season,"One of the Baltimore Orioles' best building blocks will miss the entire 2022 MLB season. Left-handed ace John Means announced Saturday that he will undergo Tommy John surgery. The procedure will likely keep Means sidelined until next season.

Means made two starts this season before experiencing elbow pain. He underwent multiple MRIs, which determined Means needed surgery to repair the issue.

Means, 28, said he was ""disappointed, but more motivated than ever"" upon hearing the news.

Means experienced a strong year in 2019, but made an even bigger impact for the Orioles in 2021. Means posted a 3.62 ERA over 146 2/3 innings with the club. His biggest moment of the season came in May, when Means threw a no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners. Means missed time late in the 2021 season due to shoulder soreness. He's started on opening day the past two seasons.

Orioles off to impressive start on the mound

The injury comes at a disappointing time, as the rest of the Orioles' pitching staff appears to have found another gear this offseason. Despite not having many household names, the Orioles have a 2.80 ERA through 14 games. That figure ranks fifth in all of baseball. The team also has a 3.00 FIP, which ranks fourth.

Jorge López and Bruce Zimmermann are among the team's biggest pitching wins thus far. López has a 2.25 ERA through 8 innings and has saved three games. His strikeout rate is way up, potentially due to increased velocity. After averaging 95.3 mph on his sinker last season, López is averaging 97.9 on the pitch in 2022.

Zimmermann's velocity is down, but his secondary offerings have looked better to start the season. Zimmermann is relying on his changeup more in 2022. The pitch has a 39.5 percent whiff rate, up from last season. He hasn't used his slider as much this season, but he has a 70 percent whiff rate on the pitch in 26 attempts.

Losing Means for the entire season will hurt, but if the Orioles continue to show improvement on the mound, he could return to pretty intriguing staff in 2023.",,https://sports.yahoo.com/orioles-ace-john-means-to-undergo-tommy-john-surgery-after-breakout-season-163637371.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F6Xdp0qqmkUsgydIl7gESg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/35acc6f0-c323-11ec-bff5-7c00a0b334ff,Yahoo,"One of the Baltimore Orioles' best building blocks will miss the entire 2022 MLB season.

Tom Brady creates $9 million in cap space for Buccaneers after restructuring contract,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady's biggest contribution to the NFL ... well, other than all the winning, might be his willingness to put his team in a better place every offseason. Brady did that again Friday, restructuring his contract.

The move gave the Buccaneers an extra $9 million in cap space for the 2022 NFL season, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Tom Brady and the Buccaneers restructured his 2022 contract today, creating over $9 million of added salary cap space for Tampa Bay as it gets ready to head into next week’s draft, league sources tell ESPN. Brady still is scheduled to be a free agent after this season. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 22, 2022

This is nothing new for Brady. He started restructuring his contract as a member of the New England Patriots. Every offseason, Brady would re-work his deal to give the Patriots — and now the Buccaneers — more cap room. The team would then use that cap space to give Brady a better supporting cast.

Brady will make the same amount of money after the restructure. He's not taking a pay cut. Instead, the team shifted how Brady's contract gets paid out. In Brady's case, that might include reducing his 2022 salary to the league minimum, but shifting the money he was supposed to make to his bonus.

I don’t know the fine print yet, but to save $9 million they are not only reducing salary to a minimum and shifting rest into bonus but also tweaking incentives to make them not count as likely to be earned. https://t.co/8j2UV5y6Bc — Greg Auman (@gregauman) April 22, 2022

That enables the team to still pay Brady the same amount, but improve its short-term cap situation.

The Buccaneers will likely use some of their new cap space to sign the players they select in the 2022 NFL draft. The team should still have cap space left after making those moves.

Other quarterbacks follow Tom Brady's lead

Brady may be credited with popularizing the restructuring trend, but many others have picked up on the practice. Former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees kept restructuring his deal to save the team cap space. Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes made the same move last offseason to put the Chiefs in a better spot financially.

While Brady was willing to adjust his deal with the Buccaneers, he did not add any more time to his contract. Brady will be a free agent following the 2022 NFL season.

"Why Jane Fonda, 84, Didn’t Think She’d Live Past 30: ‘The Fact That I’m Still Alive Is a Big Surprise’","Photo credit: David Livingston - Getty Images

Jane Fonda candidly revealed that she didn’t expect to live past 30 years old.

“Just, the fact that I’m alive and thriving is a big surprise,” she admitted.

A trying childhood and fraught relationships with both her parents, as well as three failed marriages haven’t made life easy for the 84-year-old.

Jane Fonda’s childhood was anything but easy. When she was 12 she lost her mother, who battled bipolar disorder. That loss was compounded by a “fraught adolescence” with an emotionally cold father, she once told People, which filled her with insecurities and loneliness. That’s why, after enduring so much turmoil, Fonda is shocked that she’s lived past 30.

“I never thought I would live this long,” she recently told Variety. “In a year, I’m making three movies. If you would’ve told me that at [nearing] 85, I’d be—three movies—I would not have believed it. I didn’t think that I would live past 30. So just, the fact that I’m alive and thriving is a big surprise. ”

Fonda’s mother died by suicide, and for much of her life, Fonda says she blamed herself for her mother’s passing. And it wasn’t until she dedicated her 2005 memoir to her, that, through research and medical records, she was able to really understand her mom’s history.

“When you go through that kind of research … if you can come to answers, which I was able to do, you end up being able to say, ‘It had nothing to do with me,’” she told People in 2018. “It wasn’t that I wasn’t lovable. They had issues,” she added, referring to both of her parents. “And the minute you know that, you can feel tremendous empathy for them. And you can forgive.”

In addition to feeling abandoned by her mom, Fonda’s looks were consistently criticized by her father, renowned actor Henry Fonda. “I was taught by my father that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2011. “He sent messages to me that fathers should not send: ‘Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.’”

Story continues

That sentiment deeply impacted Fonda and contributed to her longtime struggle with bulimia. “I wasn’t very happy from, I would say, puberty to 50,” she added. She was also married three times—to Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, and Ted Turner—before finally deciding to choose her happiness over a man. “I would tend to mold myself according to what my then-husband wanted me to be,” she explained to Bazaar.

So, for Fonda to be not only alive, but to be enthusiastically doing what she loves right now feels a bit unreal. In 2018, she told Ellen DeGeneres on her talkshow that she thought she’d “die lonely and probably from alcohol or something like that,” adding: “The fact that I’m not an addict, and I’m 80 and I’m working—it’s just a miracle to me.”

The latter half of Fonda’s career is just as, if not more impactful than its beginning, especially thanks to projects like Grace and Frankie. Plus, the 9 to 5 star has grown immensely as a person since her early days, which is really what pushed her to keep going.

“If you have a whole lot of time behind you and just a little in front of you, as is the case with me, I can look back and say, ‘Well, I’ve survived that,’” she told DeGeneres. “Every day I get up, and I want to pinch myself. I feel very blessed, but I’ve worked for it.”

How a Civil War-era law has brought Marjorie Taylor Greene into court,"A group of Georgia voters is hoping an arcane Constitutional law could knock U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off the ballot.

Greene, R-Ga., on Friday testified in an administrative hearing on a challenge to her candidacy for reelection, raised by a group of Georgia voters, who claim that the congresswoman helped facilitate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The riot stemmed from efforts to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election win.

Under a rarely-used provision of the 14th Amendment, she could be disqualified from the ballot. Here's what you need to know about the provision and how its influencing the 2022 midterm elections.

Judge's ruling: Georgia voters can challenge Marjorie Taylor Greene's run on 14th Amendment grounds

History of the provision

The 14th Amendment, which is comprised of five sections, was ratified in 1868, shortly after the Civil War came to an end. It was meant to put the Union's idea of what it accomplished during the Civil War into the Constitution, said Eric Foner, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at Columbia University.

Part of that was ensuring that formerly enslaved people were extended the liberties and rights granted by the Bill of Rights. For example, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States"" and cemented that no state could deprive any person of ""life, liberty or property, without due process of law"" nor deny anyone equal protection under the law.

But a lesser-known intention of the amendment was to encourage ""loyal government"" in the South.

""In other words, people holding office would not be former Confederates,"" Foner said. ""(The North) didn't fight the Civil War in order to put Confederates back into power in the South.""

The amendment's third section reads:

""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.""

Story continues

That means any former government official or military officer who promised to uphold the Constitution can't serve again if they engage in insurrection unless two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate each votes to pardon them, said Gerard Magliocca, a constitutional law professor at Indiana University.

The provision, however, isn't a formal punishment, Foner said.

""It's not a crime; it's a qualification for office,"" he said. ""It's like being 35 years old. If AOC decided right now to run for president, somebody could go to court and say she can't run because she's not 35 years old.""

Has the provision been cited before?

Greene isn't the only lawmaker whose reelection bid has been questioned on the basis of the provision recently. North Carolina voters challenged Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy, but that effort was struck down by a judge in early March. Indiana voters also sought to keep Republican Rep. Jim Banks off the ballot, an effort rejected by Indiana officials in February.

The rule was enforced in a number of cases during Reconstruction, removing office-holders for previously holding positions in the Confederacy. But since then, its use has been ""very rare,"" according to Foner.

""If you walked into a law school today, you would be hard pressed to find anybody who knew anything about this section, even though it's been in the constitution for 150 years,"" Foner said.

Since Reconstruction, the provision has only been cited once.

Wisconsin Rep. Victor Berger, the first Socialist elected to Congress, was convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919 and subsequently barred from Congress after the Senate and House asserted he supported insurrection by opposing American participation in World War I. The Supreme Court in 1921 overturned Berger's conviction.

Victor Berger

""The court said, 'No, no, you can't kick the guy out for this, or, at least, you can't prosecute him for simply his opinion, that is the U.S. should not be in the war,'"" Foner said. ""So his conviction was overturned and then Congress said, 'Well, alright, I guess we have to let him back in.' ""

Berger rejoined Congress in 1923 and served three additional terms, according to House archives.

Section 3 is regaining relevance in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

""The January 6th Capitol riot is widely understood as an insurrection,"" Magliocca said. ""As a result, those officials or former officials who engaged in that insurrection could be disqualified from further service.""

What does that mean today?

Because the provision has rarely been used, its execution is uncharted territory, experts say.

Paul Campos, a constitutional law professor at University of Colorado-Boulder, said ""these people can and should be barred from federal office via Section 3.""

Greene is the only Congress member whose challenge has been allowed to proceed.

Magliocca said that the application of Section 3 will be determined by courts and that ""at least one"" of the challenges will likely succeed. State law largely determines who can bring a challenge, he added.

The challenge to Greene's candidacy will likely reach the Supreme Court, unless thrown out first, Foner said. But once there, it's hard to know how the Court will proceed.

Additional context: Georgia voters argue Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene isn't eligible to be reelected

""The Supreme Court chose the president back in 2000 with Bush v. Gore; it seems like they're not modest about walking into things about candidates,"" Foner said. ""But on the other hand, you never know. This is so unprecedented that you actually really can't predict what people on the Court would say in a case like this.""

Alternatively, the challenge could skip the courts all together. Campos said that Congress can enforce the provision, both in terms of its own internal rules and by statute.

""Theoretically, the House in a majority vote could just say, 'Well, she's not qualified anymore,' "" Foner said.

It's not likely discussion about the provision will soon cease. Though the rule could influence midterms now, it might also take center stage in the 2024 general election.

"DeSantis targeting Disney is a 'boneheaded move' and shows he's trying to be 'king of Florida,' says Rep. Charlie Crist","US Rep. Charlie Crist criticizes Gov. Ron DeSantis as ""un-American"" for targeting Disney with special session bills on April 20, 2022, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Florida. Phil Sears/AP

Rep. Charlie Crist said Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to be the ""king of Florida"" after targeting Disney.

DeSantis signed a bill on Friday stripping Disney of its self-governing status.

Crist, a Democrat in Congress and former Florida governor, is running for his old job against DeSantis.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' decision to strip Disney of its self-governing status was slammed as a ""boneheaded move"" by a former Florida governor.

Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, who served as Florida's governor from 2007 to 2011 as a Republican, criticized DeSantis in a tweet.

""Attacking Disney, threatening to harm our state's economic powerhouse that creates so many jobs and brings in so many tourism dollars is a boneheaded move however you look at it. Ron's a threat to our state's economy and he's gotta go in November,"" Crist said in the tweet on Friday.

In an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on Thursday, Crist said DeSantis seems to want to be the ""king of Florida,"" calling the sitting governor ""an angry dude.""

""What he's trying to do is have a one-man rule of this great state,"" Crist told the Sentinel. ""This governor seems to really want to centralize all power in himself.""

Crist is running for governor to unseat DeSantis. He was recently endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, The Hill's Max Greenwood reported.

DeSantis signed a bill on Friday to dissolve Walt Disney World of its self-governing capabilities by June 2023. It comes after Disney slammed Florida's controversial Parental Rights in Education legislation, dubbed by activists and critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

The LGBTQ legislation was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 28 and is set to take effect on July 1. It would, in general, ban discussions of sexuality and gender identity in classrooms from kindergarten to third grade and would allow parents to sue schools if staff members facilitate those conversations.

Story continues

The day DeSantis signed the bill into law, Disney issued a statement vowing to advocate for the law's repeal, saying it ""should never have passed and should never have been signed into law.""

On Thursday, Crist told the Sentinel that Disney was being ""punished"" by DeSantis.

""They're being punished for defying this governor and not living up to what he wanted them to do, to support this law that was so offensive to so many in our state. And this is how he responds?"" Crist told the outlet. ""That's not serving with a servant's heart. That's wanting to be the king of Florida. Well, he's not.""

Florida's Senate Minority Leader Gary Farmer told Insider that DeSantis' public dispute with Disney is shifting attention from other legislative items on DeSantis' agenda — namely, the new proposed redistricting map that would give the GOP an edge in the state at the expense of Black voters.

""Governor DeSantis' attack on Disney was designed to act as a smokescreen for the much more devious original and singular purpose of this special session, the passage of a racist and unconstitutional redistricting plan,"" Farmer said.

In a tweet on Thursday, Crist appeared to agree, saying DeSantis' redistricting plan ""silenced Black and brown voices.""

Disney government dissolution bill signed by DeSantis,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Friday to dissolve the private government Walt Disney World controls on its property in the state, punishing the entertainment giant for opposing a new law that critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”

The move is expected to have huge tax implications for Disney and further sour the relationship between the Republican-led government and a major political player whose theme parks have transformed Orlando into one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.

For DeSantis, the attack on Disney is the latest front in a culture war waged over policies involving race, gender and the coronavirus, battles he has harnessed to make himself one of the most popular Republicans in the country and a likely 2024 presidential candidate.

The law would eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the 55-year-old Disney government is known, as well as a handful of other similar districts by June 2023. The measure does allow for the districts to be reestablished, leaving an avenue to renegotiate the future of the deal that allows the company to provide services such as zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure.

DeSantis said Friday that the company would end up paying more taxes than it currently does and that the law isn't expected to cause tax increases for residents around Disney. He gave no additional details.

The dispute began with Disney’s criticism of a new law barring instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade as well as instruction that is not “age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” DeSantis and his fellow Republicans have defended the law as reasonable, saying that parents, not teachers, should be discussing such topics with children.

Under mounting pressure, Disney eventually said it would suspend political donations in the state and that it would support organizations working to oppose the new law.

Story continues

“You're a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're gonna marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” DeSantis said Friday before signing the bill into law at a ceremony in Hialeah Gardens. “We view that as a provocation, and we're going to fight back against that.""

The governor has hammered Disney for coming out against the bill, portraying the company as a purveyor of “woke” ideology that injects inappropriate subjects into children's entertainment. In a fundraising pitch sent out this week, DeSantis told supporters, “It took a look under the hood to see what Disney has become to truly understand their inappropriate influence.”

Republican Rep. Randy Fine, sponsor of the bill to eliminate the Disney district, has said Disney is a guest in the state and that Floridians are not interested in the company's California values.

“You kick the hornet’s nest, things come up,” Fine told lawmakers in the GOP-controlled statehouse this week.

Democrats have slammed the Disney measure as petty retaliation, warning that homeowners could face tax bills if they have to absorb costs from the company, though details are far from clear.

“The devil is in the details and we don’t yet today have the details,” said Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, whose county is partially home to Disney World. He added it would be “catastrophic for our budget” if the county had to assume the costs for public safety at the theme park resort.

Disney is one of Florida’s biggest private employers, last year saying it had more than 60,000 workers in the state. It is not immediately clear how the company or local governments around its properties would be affected if the district was dissolved.

The creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, and the control it gave Disney over 27,000 acres (11,000 hectares) in Florida, was a crucial element in the company’s plans to build near Orlando in the 1960s. Company officials said they needed autonomy to plan a futuristic city along with the theme park. The city never materialized, however; instead, it morphed into the Epcot theme park.

The company is a major political player in Florida, as well as the rest of the country. The Walt Disney Co. and its affiliates made more than $20 million in political contributions to both Republicans and Democrats in the 2020 campaign cycle, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks such spending.

That same year, Disney-related entities funneled $10.5 million to the America First Action committee, which supports Republican former President Donald Trump. Disney also contributed $1.2 million to support Democratic President Joe Biden’s campaign.",Anthony Izaguirre,https://news.yahoo.com/disney-government-dissolution-bill-signed-192203693.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/w60QlUUVHZ7SFHYjrdlygw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mFVDW3t5jpteoe9wv2xFSQ--~B/aD0zNTQ5O3c9NTMyNDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ff04a724589cbcf331496d6afbdc6d6b,Yahoo,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

Is it worth provoking Putin to add Sweden and Finland to NATO?,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

Sweden and Finland, two European nations that have long valued strategic neutrality, appear to be inching closer to joining NATO in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The security landscape has completely changed,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters last week at a meeting with her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin. Andersson’s recent comments represent a significant shift in her view on the value of NATO membership. Early last month , she said that Sweden joining the alliance would “further destabilize this area of Europe and increase tensions.”

Andersson’s change in opinion is indicative of evolving views among the citizens of both countries in reaction to the steady stream of horrifying news out of Ukraine. In a recent poll, 68% of Finns said they support joining NATO , up from just 24% last year. For the first time ever, a majority of Swedes said they also favor joining, according to a poll released this week.

Although both nations have deep cultural and economic ties with Europe, Finland and Sweden have historically declined to pursue NATO membership — even as more than a dozen countries in eastern Europe have joined the alliance since the fall of the Soviet Union. Sweden’s resistance is rooted in its policy of neutrality, which dates back to the early 1800s. After fighting off a Soviet invasion during World War II, Finland established a formally neutral position, largely to avoid provoking further aggression.

Formed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense — meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia’s Foreign Ministry has warned of “serious military and political consequences” if Sweden and Finland join the alliance.

Story continues

Why there’s debate

Supporters say there are clear benefits to adding Sweden and Finland to NATO. They argue that the invasion serves as a startling reminder of how dangerous it can be for countries on Russia’s borders. If they were NATO members, the two Nordic countries would have the force of some of the world’s most powerful militaries — including the U.S. — as a bulwark against any Russian incursion.

Some defense analysts believe NATO and its members have plenty to gain by bringing in Sweden and Finland. Though both nations are relatively small, experts say their militaries are still formidable. The two countries would also provide a valuable strategic foothold along Russia’s northwest flank, particularly along Finland’s 830-mile border with Russia. Others say expanding NATO would be yet another nonmilitary means of punishing Putin for his assault on Ukraine.

But skeptics worry about potential retaliation from Putin, particularly at a time when he’s vulnerable and liable to lash out. Some also argue that increasing NATO’s foothold along Russia’s border would create opportunities for conflict that could spiral into another world war.

There are also those who believe that NATO shouldn't exist at all. Some on the right believe that the alliance allows smaller nations to neglect their own defense capabilities, knowing that major powers will come to their rescue. Observers on the far left, on the other hand, say that anything that promotes military force over nonviolent forms of collaboration is ultimately harmful to the world.

What’s next

There are two major steps that need to be taken before Sweden and Finland could become part of NATO. First, their Parliaments would have to formally vote to join. Then, the legislatures of each of the 30 current NATO countries would have to approve their membership — a process that has taken about a year in the recent past.

Perspectives

Supporters

The war in Ukraine has made it obvious why Sweden and Finland should join

“Who can blame the Finns and the Swedes for wanting to jump right in? … After seeing what's happening to Ukraine, they don’t want to be the next Ukraine. And it’s clear that Putin does not want to challenge any of the NATO countries directly.” — Kevin Baron, Defense One executive editor, to MSNBC

Russia probably isn’t willing to go to war to keep Sweden and Finland out of NATO

“Putin views Finland and Sweden differently than Ukraine because of their different histories. Ukraine is seen as part of an imagined ‘Russian world’ by Putin. Sweden and Finland are, therefore, less comparable to Ukraine, beyond their proximity to Russia.” — Thomas O Falk, Al Jazeera

Adding new NATO members is a sound, nonmilitary way to punish Russia

“It would be a dramatic reversal of fortunes and would demonstrate the agility of the liberal democratic countries in applying the diplomatic element of power, well below the threshold of war, that gray-zone space in which Russia — and, for that matter, China — has been so nimble in the recent past.” — Michael Miklaucic, The Hill

Both countries would bring plenty of benefits to the NATO alliance

“Finland and Sweden wouldn’t be alliance freeloaders. Their strategic location in the Baltic Sea could be critical in a wider conflict with Russia. Finland already punches above its weight militarily, and wealthy Sweden can afford its announced defense-spending increases. A secure Europe better capable of defending itself serves American interests.” — Editorial, Wall Street Journal

Ukraine is a reminder of our responsibility to protect each other

“Ukraine is a game-changer in European security. The real threat to fellow member-states leaves us all with no option but to look again at how we see our responsibilities to one another.” — Editorial, Irish Times

NATO membership would have saved Ukraine

“If only NATO was more popular amongst Ukrainians and properly marketed as a security guarantee against Russia, Ukraine could have been saved from eight or more years of violence and suffering. The lesson to be learned is that NATO did not enlarge far or fast enough.” — Daniel Ramallo, National Interest

Skeptics

Russia might attack to keep Sweden and Finland out

“Would Russia seriously consider an attack on Finland or Sweden? While it may seem unlikely, the West should not underestimate the possibility that Mr. Putin, feeling isolated, backed into a corner, and under a time constraint, may make an otherwise rash decision.” — Sascha Glaeser, Washington Times

A greater NATO presence on Russia’s border increases the odds of catastrophic conflict

“Finland—if it allows NATO bases, troops, and weaponry within its borders—could permanently heighten the hair-trigger environment that now exists between the Kremlin and Washington.” — Michael Hirsh, Foreign Policy

NATO’s expansion after the Cold War inspired Putin’s invasion of Ukraine

“If there had been no decision to move NATO eastward to include Ukraine, Crimea and the Donbass would be part of Ukraine today, and there would be no war in Ukraine.” — John Mearsheimer, political scientist, to New Yorker

NATO makes the world less safe

“To the degree that this rudderless security pact has made war easier, more salable, and more attractive for Western leaders than diplomacy, the alliance has been a liability to peace and stability.” — Chase Madar, The Nation

Greater militarism will never create a path to peace

“Europe goes ahead and arms itself to the teeth to protect itself. … So therefore, [Russia says] we have to arm ourselves to the teeth to defend ourselves from the onslaught of this extraordinarily powerful force against NATO. I mean, if anybody’s observing this from outer space, they’d be cracking up in laughter.” — Noam Chomsky, linguist and political commentator, to Intercept

The U.S. shouldn’t sign up to protect even more weak countries

“We have to understand that nothing is done in a vacuum, and for Finland and Sweden to be added to NATO adds a burden to the entire alliance. … And it adds yet another level of potential risk for the United States.” — Daniel Davis, foreign policy expert, to The Hill

"This Week in Apps: Google bans call-recording apps, Snap’s Q1 and BeReal hype – TechCrunch","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.

The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.

Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.

This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.

Top Stories

Google bans call-recording apps

Google updated its Play Store policies to ban third-party call-recording apps from the Play Store, effective as of May 11. Developers had been using the Accessibility API to enable remote call audio recording as a workaround to make these apps work after Google blocked call recording on Android 6 and via the microphone on Android 10. The change was announced alongside other updates on April 6, but a Reddit post drove new awareness of the crackdown. Google also livestreamed a policy update this week where it explained this was not actually a “new” policy, necessarily, but rather a clarification to an existing one. (The video is labeled April 2020 but this appears to be a mislabel, because YouTube shows it was streamed April 2022 — and commenters are also noting the typo.) While that may be true, the company had not taken action on apps using the Accessibility API in this way.

In the webinar, Moun Choi, who works on the Trust & Safety Play Regional Ops team for Google Play, explained the focus of the policy was directed toward third-party apps where the call recording was taking place without the other user’s awareness. The default dialer on the phone would not be impacted by this, as it doesn’t need the accessible capability to get access to the incoming audio stream, he said. The company didn’t clarify if existing apps would be removed from the Play Store when the policy goes into effect, however.

BeReal: Hype or hit?

An app called BeReal, founded by former GoPro employee Alexis Barreyat along with Kévin Perreau, launched in December 2019 with the idea to ask users to post an unedited photo once per day after receiving a notification. The user then has up to 2 minutes to share what they’re up to and see the photos their friends also posted. The app has recently gained a lot of attention amid rapid growth and a daily active user base that’s now reached nearly 3 million, according to data from Apptopia. But when an app grows this quickly, there are usually some paid user acquisition efforts involved. This week, we took a look into how BeReal may be capitalizing on its newer features and college ambassador program to drive installs and its five-star reviews. The verdict: It’s too soon to know if BeReal can self-sustain when the funds run out.

Musk secures his Twitter bid

Elon Musk this week secured $46.5 billion to acquire Twitter, per an SEC filing. The Telsa and SpaceX chief’s offer for the social network includes $25.5 billion in debt financing from Morgan Stanley and other firms, including Bank of America, Barclays, MUFG, Societe Generale, Mizuho Bank and BNP Paribas. Musk said he’s committed to about $21 billion in equity financing. Previously, Musk hadn’t been specific about how he would pay for the investment, so these financial commitments make the deal more serious. The tech CEO hasn’t yet said if he will make a tender offer, however. Twitter had already adopted a poison-pill defense of its equity as a result of Musk’s unsolicited bid.

The update also introduces a new map; new search tools for finding friends, places and addresses; more automated check-ins; a new profile section called My world for showing off your hangouts; and more.

It also added support for fundraisers in Reels.

Snap’s Q1 2022 saw healthy user growth amid an earnings miss. Snap missed Wall Street expectations for profit and sales in the first quarter, pulling in a loss of 2 cents versus the expected 1 cent earnings, and revenue of $1.06 billion versus the $1.07 billion expected. But the app’s bright spot was user growth, 332 million DAUs (up 18% YoY) versus 330 million expected. This follows five previous quarters of user growth north of 20%. But Snap is still adapting to the fallout from Apple’s Privacy Changes. Though it’s implemented new measurement solutions that better respect user privacy, Snap told investors the changes take time. “They put a serious onus on advertisers to adapt and reset their advertising campaigns across not just Snap, but all platforms. We empathize with them,” says Snap Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman.

Deal terms feel like dart boards these days – TechCrunch,"Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.

When Andreessen Horowitz unveiled its new early-stage startup accelerator, which has been in the works for over a year, my eyes searched for two things: check size and ownership target. I care about value-add services and micro-focuses, such as a goal to back diverse founders or a Web 2.5 track, but I first care about how new programs, such as A16z START, are advertising their money.

The reason? The standard deal of an accelerator says a lot about which founders they plan to attract. Some programs may tout their check size, others may highlight the non-dilutive nature of their cash and a select few are claiming that equity in exchange for access is an outdated way to work.

In this case, a16z is going to decide deal terms on a case by case basis for founders who get to the final round of the interview process. The max that a founder can get is $1 million in initial funding. The vagueness, and general focus, seemingly piggybacks off of Sequoia’s recently announced program, which will invest a check size of $1 million into founders for an undisclosed equity stake. While I’m pro more money going into early-stage founders, I’m also pro tell me how much equity I’ll be giving up before I dedicate time to the interview process. So, I thought the vagueness was kind of weird. Not malicious, necessarily, but weird!

it is weird that neither a16z or sequoia have publicly disclosed what ownership they're targeting in their new accelerator efforts, right? — natasha (@nmasc_) April 19, 2022

Of course, tech Twitter had some thoughts! One of my followers said that wiggle room is helpful, especially for a firm like A16z for which it’s their first formal foray into backing startups as early as possible. I don’t disagree with that, similar to traditional demo days, which assume that every startup in a batch is ready to raise money on the same day; a standard deal assumes that every startup’s monetary needs are created equally, regardless of solution, background or sector.

Another said the deals are quiet so other accelerators can’t copy their terms. A lot of folks thought they’re going after Y Combinator, because why leave all the upside to one Index-fund-lookin’ institution. One day startups may be asking themselves: Y9r or a16z?

For more thoughts, read my TechCrunch+ piece: Why does A16z need its own Y Combinator? You can also listen to the latest Equity podcast, which got into this topic and much, much more.

In this newsletter, we’ll talk about Opendoor alumni, a post-layoff pivot and JOKR’s interview. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend, following me on Twitter or subscribing to my personal blog.

When one door opens

Our deal of the week is Kindred! Mary Ann Azevedo reported this week that Opendoor alums Justine Palefsky and Tasneem Amina founded Kindred, a startup that wants to make traveling more accessible through home swapping. So far, the duo has raised $7.75 million to help make the option available to more people.

Here’s why it’s important: The Opendoor alumni network is certainly making moves, with Kindred being the latest entrepreneurial haunt to come out of residential real estate company. This upstart particularly stands out because of its focus on accessibility, which the proptech sector could always use more of.

Read this excerpt from CEO Justine Palefsky, in which she describes the “aha moment” of the startup:

“We started Kindred after we struggled with the problem ourselves. We were both working remotely and we wanted to take advantage of that flexibility to travel more and work from elsewhere. But none of the existing solutions or ways to do that really made sense for us and for our lives,” Palefsky said. “We felt like we had three options. One, we could get an Airbnb somewhere, which became too expensive for trips longer than just a few nights. Or you could give up your home and become a nomad. Or you could run your home like a hotel and put it on Airbnb to finance your travel. None of those options felt right for us because they are inconvenient and a little scary.”

Flockjay lands on something new

Months after cutting half its staff, edtech startup Flockjay has landed on a new vision for how to disrupt tech sales: start from the inside, out. CEO Shaan Hathiramani opened up about the pivot, the cuts and what he learned when he tried to build a bootcamp and eventually landed on a SaaS tool.

Here’s why it’s important: The company most recently raised venture funding in an $11 million Series A in January 2021, per Crunchbase data. Hathiramani said the growth pace made it feel like Flockjay was “running about six or seven businesses at once.” He went on to say that the team was running an admissions and selection business, a training business, a coaching and placement business and an alumni community, something that caused burnout among the less than 100-person team.

More problematic, perhaps, was the fact that Flockjay was not “growing at the speed that you want it too.” So, he turned to his board and decided to scale back programming until they found a more sustainable business — announced today.

JOKR’s fresh take on grocery delivery

Our own Christine Hall sat down with Ralf Wenzel, JOKR’s founder and CEO, to talk about the grocery delivery wars and his company’s differentiated model. Despite growing pains, the company went on to raise $260 million in December to become a billion-dollar company. So, how did it convince people that something as unprofitable and hard to scale as grocery delivery is worth more investment money?

Here’s why it’s important: In the interview, Wenzel talks about building a “proposition out more toward fresh” products like fruits, vegetables and meat cuts. The CEO says by not just focusing on convenience store goods, the company hit “fully gross profit positive on a group level for our local business across all of our countries after 12 months of operations.”

To me, this signals that customer habits have matured so much that they want more than convenience from delivery services. Instead of a last-minute crutch, folks want help with everyday needs — which means startups can differentiate if they think of authentic services ahead of everyone else.

Now I’m hungry:

"‘The Northman’ Filmmaker Robert Eggers on Nailing Nude Battle Scene, Managing Epic Production","Standing front and center beneath the big screen inside Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre, Robert Eggers had an important message to share about The Northman. “I want to say that this is not a film by Robert Eggers,” said the filmmaker on Monday night ahead of the premiere as he was joined by actors Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe, Gustav Lindh and Oscar Novak. “It’s a film made by an enormous amount of collaborators.”

Eggers went on to single out many of them, starting with Focus Features and New Regency for backing his vision for a Viking epic that tells the story of a young prince as he seeks to avenge his father’s murder. “Supporting a filmmaker and making a large-scale film that’s not a superhero movie is a very rare thing, and I truly feel incredibly grateful and privileged to have made this film,” he noted, before adding that it was “a beast to make,” echoing earlier comments made to The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet.

Asked to single out his most stressful day on set, Eggers said the entire shoot “was only hard,” due to all the elements of an authentic and large-scale production. “If it’s not a Viking raid of a village with hundreds of extras of stuntmen, horses, cows, chickens, geese, children, then it was a storm at sea at night on a Viking ship, or a naked sword fight on a volcano,” he noted, with the latter referencing the (spoiler alert!) epic climax that features a nude battle between Skarsgard’s Amleth and Claes Bang’s Fjölnir. Below, Eggers opens up about why they had to add CG genitals to the scene, his meticulous research process and why you won’t find him sneaking in the back of any screenings on opening weekend.

What do you make of this scene — Hollywood Boulevard lined with fans, Viking music playing in the background?

Childhood me is very proud, so that’s cool.

With The Northman, you made the leap to $70 million-plus filmmaking. What was the best part of having more money to play with? And the most challenging part of a bigger budget?

Again, talking about childhood me, I got to build a Viking village in a Viking city with longships and merchant ships. It’s completely crazy. But the challenge is, you get a lot more responsibility on your shoulders, and that can be intimidating at times, but me and my collaborators, we were up for the challenge.

We could spend weeks talking about your meticulous research process. In the simplest terms, what does it look like? Do you lock yourself away? How do you tune out while you focus?

I like to read a lot of books and watch things. I listen to podcasts as much as I can. But we had the privilege of literally working with the world’s greatest Viking historians and archeologists in the field of Viking studies on this movie, all the way from the writing through postproduction. It’s a unique film in that way.

This movie reunites you with Anya Taylor-Joy. How has she changed as a performer since The Witch?

She was great when she was 18, she’s great now. Both of us have gotten better at our craft. I think where she’s changed the most is just that her professionalism on set is an inspiration for everyone who works with her. I know that’s boring, but it is cool, especially when she’s wearing a potato sack barefoot in the mud with horizontal rain, and she’s got a good attitude. That’s helpful for everybody.

Professionalism is never boring, and some of your collaborators have given you similar compliments tonight. I imagine that wasn’t always easy while managing this production. What’s the most stressful day?

If it’s not a Viking raid of a village with hundreds of extras of stuntmen, horses, cows, chickens, geese, children, then it was a storm at sea at night on a Viking ship, or a naked sword fight on a volcano. I mean, there was nothing easy about making this movie. It was only hard.

Since you brought it up, let’s talk about the naked sword fight. Did you have to do some digital erasure there?

We actually had to add things digitally because they were wearing thongs [instead of being naked] because no one wanted to get their bits chopped off. So, we actually had to add some CG genitals for certain shots so that they didn’t look too Ken doll-ish. You’ve got to make it look real, so I’m sure we did some full-body scans of Alex. They’re out there.

Robert Eggers explained why he had to add CGI genitals to Alexander Skarsgård's naked Viking fight in #TheNorthman pic.twitter.com/eLRFzIJZiP — The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) April 21, 2022

I read that you’ve said that nobody is Method on your sets. Is that a rule or just coincidence?

If someone wants to be Method, they’re more than welcome to be Method. But my main direction is don’t blink, don’t move your face, and say your lines. When you have an archetypal story with archetypal characters — Alexander Skarsgard looks like a Viking, is playing a Viking, on a mountain and dressed as a Viking — just say your lines. I know there’s more to it than that, but in a way, with this cast, it’s almost that simple.

Where will you be this weekend when it opens here? Will you sneak into any screenings?

I saw this movie 19 times in the last two weeks of postproduction. I’m all set, thanks. I’ll watch it tonight, but then I’m done.

Focus Features kept the party going with a post-premiere event held at L.A.’s new hotspot Mother Wolf. Earlier on the carpet, Taylor-Joy praised Eggers for being “my original film teacher,” crediting him for how she’s grown in her career. “What I really realized is how much of the way that I comport myself on set, how much of that comes from him,” she explained. “He’s a great person to learn from.” Alberto E.

Harry Styles Welcomes Lizzo for Pair of Hits at Coachella Weekend 2,"Harry Styles and Lizzo perform for the SiriusXM and Pandora Opening Drive Super Concert Series at the Fillmore Miami Beach during Super Bowl Week on Jan. 30, 2020.

Harry Styles brought out special guest Lizzo during his headlining set at weekend two of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Friday night.

Toward the end of his high-energy main stage performance, the 28-year-old British pop star surprised festivalgoers by inviting the “Truth Hurts” singer onstage for a dazzling cover of Gloria Gaynor’s 1978 disco anthem “I Will Survive” and a lively rendition of One Direction‘s popular “What Makes You Beautiful.”

During their festive Coachella team-up, the two friends — who have formed a sweet bond in recent years — strutted up and down the stage donning brightly colored faux fur coats while belting out the pair of hits. “I Will Survive” spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978-79, and “What Makes You Beautiful” enjoyed four weeks atop the chart in 2012.

“Proud of you @harrystyles. Thank u for having me,” Lizzo captioned an overjoyed selfie of herself alongside Styles on Instagram.

The singer-rapper-songwriter-flautist, 33, who hosted Saturday Night Live last weekend, teased her Coachella appearance earlier Friday by sharing a TikTok video of herself traveling to the California desert. “I’m bored otw to Coachella,” she captioned the clip.

Styles made his Coachella debut during the opening weekend of the festival on April 15. During his performance, the Grammy winner welcomed Shania Twain for duets of her hits “Man! I Feel Like a Woman!” and “You’re Still the One.” With his new album, Harry’s House, set for release on May 20, the singer also took the opportunity to play news songs “As It Was,” “Boyfriends” and “Late Night Talking.”

"From Father’s Day to Birthdays, These Are the Best Gifts for New Dads","If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SPY.com may receive an affiliate commission.

Father’s Day is almost here and for new dads, their first Father’s Day is one of the most memorable. Becoming a dad is an exciting time. It’s also overwhelming, exhausting, and TBH a little bit terrifying. Thankfully, there are plenty of great parenting books to help with some of the scary parts, plus helpful guides on baby products from SPY (check out our guides on baby monitors, baby gadgets and items new parents can’t live without). But what about products specifically for dad? We’ve got you covered there as well with a list of the best gifts for new dads.

First Father’s Day gifts can be a way to pamper a new pop, help him get his grooming on, enjoy a mocktail and catch some sleep whenever possible (seriously, nap when the baby naps). Gifts for new dads can also be products that enable dads to help their partner, whether that means sanitizing bottles or pump parts, taking the little one for a stroll or prepping a delicious dinner. Then there are the first Father’s Day gifts that are all about cuteness — when in doubt, get it personalized.

From socks to matching outfits, silky sheets to baby carriers, these are the best gifts for new dads.

1. Our First Father’s Day Together Shirt and Onesie

FOR THE MATCHING DAD

Most grown men try to avoid wearing the same outfit as someone else unless that person is tiny and cute. Help a dad celebrate his first Father’s Day with a matching t-shirt and onesie combo that will elicit all the ‘awwwws.’

2. Isshindo Honpo Captain America Sheet Mask

FOR THE DAD WHO NEEDS SOME PAMPERING

If becoming a new dad is wearing on your skin, it’s time for some TLC. Even dads who don’t typically focus on grooming or pampering will appreciate the new Captain America face masks from Isshindo. SPY received a sample and we loved how moisturizing the Vitamin C and collagen-packed masks felt. It also felt cool to look like Captain America. Dads are the true superheroes.

3. Wide Mouth HydroFlask

FOR THE THIRSTY DAD

New dads have likely spent months making decisions about names, nursery colors, which car seat/stroller/crib/baby monitor/etc. to buy. Becoming a new dad requires a lot of decisions. Give new dads a high-quality water bottle from Hydro Flask and let them customize the bottle and make really fun, super easy decisions. Available in several sizes (we like the Wide Mouth option that makes it easy to add ice), HydroFlasks are vacuum-sealed to keep cold drinks cold for 24 hours, hot drinks hot for 12 hours, and are dishwasher friendly. SPY received a sample of HydroFlask’s personalized bottle and choosing the size, colors, and accessories, and being able to personalize the bottle with a name was a fun and easy decision.

4. Ergobaby Omni Breeze Baby Carrier

FOR THE DAD ON THE GO

Not sure which new dads can benefit from a baby carrier? That’s easy. The answer is — all new dads. This is without a doubt one of the best gifts for new dads. Whether your new dad likes to hike trails or hike through the mall, take airplane trips or short drives to the park, a baby carrier is one of the most useful items for new parents. It allows them to be hands-free while still keeping their little ones close. It helps new parents bond with their babies and carriers like the Ergobaby Breeze evenly distribute weight to help lessen back pain and can be used from birth all the way up to 45 pounds.

5. My Sheets Rock

FOR HOT DADS

All dads are hot (yeah dads!), but for those who are literally hot, especially when sleeping, they need sheets to keep them cool. Sleep is always important and even more so for new dads, who are probably getting much less shut-eye than they are used to. SPY received a sample of the high-grade bamboo rayon cooling sheets from My Sheets Rock and we agree — these sheets rock. They are uber soft, moisture-wicking, odor eliminating, and cool to the touch. Plus, their packaging is super fun (there are sound effects!) making them another easy gift to order and present to a new dad.

8. Henson AL13 Razor

Stubble may look cool, but when it’s time to get cheek to cheek with newborns, a clean-shaven dad will have a better snuggle time. Babies should not have to deal with beard rash. We like the Henson AL13 Razor, which is designed to be the last razor dads will ever have to buy (save your money for the college fund!). Made from aerospace-grade aluminum, the Henson promises a precise and close shave that leaves users with baby soft skin, which is exactly what new dads need.

Wildfires explode in drought-hit New Mexico,"Smoke drifts from a fire in the neighbourhood of The Farm, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S., April 22, 2022 in this image obtained from social media via REUTERS

TAOS, N.M., April 23 (Reuters) - Wind-driven wildfires exploded in size in northern New Mexico, destroying multiple homes and forcing hundreds to flee mountain villages as blazes raged early in the year in the parched U.S. Southwest.

Two wildfires merged northwest of Las Vegas, New Mexico and raced through 15 miles of forest driven by winds of over 75 mph (121 kph), local authorities and fire officials said on Saturday.

To the northeast, fierce winds sent another blaze towards the Philmont Scout Ranch and the village of Cimarron.

The wildfires were the most severe of nearly two dozen in the U.S. Southwest and raised concerns the region was in for a brutal fire year as a decades-long drought combined with abundant dry vegetation.

""Fire season isn't even here yet, you know this is April,"" said Michael Johnson, a spokesman for the Santa Fe National Forest and a 20-year veteran wildland firefighter. ""This is probably one of the biggest fire events I've been associated with.""

The so-called Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires combined to burn 42,341 acres, an area larger than Florida's Disney World. The blaze was set to turn east into dry grassland, giving crews a chance to bulldoze fire breaks to protect Mora and other villages to the north, said incident commander Jayson Coil.

Over 500 homes were evacuated but some people chose to stay behind, according to local authorities.

""We have heard there was pretty extensive damage,"" said Joy Ansley, a spokeswoman for San Miguel County in Las Vegas. ""It sounds like Pendaries was maybe hit pretty hard.""

Pendaries is a rural community with dozens of homes as well as a resort area and golf club near the village of Rociada.

Climate change has lowered winter snowpacks and allowed larger and more extreme fires to start earlier in the year, according to scientists. read more

Around 35 miles east of Taos, New Mexico, the Cooks Peak fire threatened the Philmont Scout Ranch and village of Cimarron. Firefighters in Arizona continued to contain the Tunnel fire near Flagstaff which has burned dozens of homes.

KYIV, April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will travel to Kyiv on Sunday and hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian leader said on Saturday.

He told a news conference in Kyiv that he would discuss the kinds of weapons that Ukraine needs to battle Russia's invasion.

Holy Fire lights up Jerusalem's Holy Sepulchre,"Metropolitan Fenidictus, the Patriarchate of Bethlehem, attends the Holy Fire ceremony, in the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank April 23, 2022. REUTERS/Mussa Qawasma

JERUSALEM, April 23 (Reuters) - With processions, chants and ululations, thousands of Christian Palestinians and pilgrims celebrated the Holy Fire ceremony at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Saturday, the first to be held since Israel imposed new restrictions on attendance.

Citing public safety, Israeli authorities sought to limit participation to 1,700 worshippers, a move criticised by church leaders as an infringement of the right to freedom of worship. It was subsequently increased to 4,000.

The mysterious, millennium-old ceremony, which celebrates Jesus's resurrection, has drawn over ten thousand worshippers in previous years.

After hours of anticipation from the crowd, Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox patriarch entered the tomb where Christians believe Jesus was buried and emerged carrying a lighted candle - without the aid of matches.

Within seconds, the light spread across the darkened church that is revered by Christians as the site of Jesus's crucifixion, burial and resurrection. The bells competed with cheers from the crowd as a smoky haze filled the chapels.

Michael Toumayan, a 36-year-old Armenian Christian, was among the first to receive the light.

""It’s an honour,"" he said. ""My father has been doing this since he was a kid and he’s passing down this tradition to me.""

After two years of COVID-19 travel restrictions, Israel has recently started allowing foreign tourists back into the country and Christians had arrived from around the world.

It took ""a lot of faith and determination"" to make it, said Alina Lord, 48, who flew in from Romania. She woke up at 5 a.m. to attend and managed to secure a position right across the tomb's opening.

For Sophia Gorgis, 65, who fled the Syrian war to Sweden, it had been a lifelong dream to celebrate the Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem.

""I have no words,” she said, choking up. ""As soon as we got our (Swedish) passports, we signed up for this trip.""

The Holy Sepulchre lies at the heart of the Old City's Christian Quarter in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move that has not won international recognition.

The Greek and Armenian Orthodox churches share custody of the Holy Sepulchre with the Roman Catholics, who celebrated Easter last week.

In the past, the light set fire to people's clothes, even their hair, said Tareq Abu Gharbiyyeh, East Jerusalem's fire chief who has been fire-proofing the ceremony for the last 30 years.

""Thankfully, it was nothing serious,"" he said.

This year, too, the ceremony ended safely.
