"‘Beyond troubling’: Current, former government officials tied to human trafficking probe in Georgia","Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

Monmouth University law class tries to save Armando Galarraga's (almost) perfect game,"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

REWIND: Missed call leaves Detroit's Armando Galarraga one out shy of perfect game

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

Monmouth University students (clockwise, from upper left) Antonio Bulzomi, Hannah Latshaw, Gabriella Griffo and Georgia Watkins

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Roseanne Barr: I’m a Victim of ‘Witch-Burning’ Cancel Culture,"Vera Anderson/WireImage

Roseanne Barr has a lengthy list of controversies over her decades in the business. Though the scandals show no sign of stopping, after the cancellation of her Roseanne revival the comic has had little-to-no platform to let ‘er rip. One cannot have controversies without an audience, which, apart from her active YouTube Channel, Barr has lost almost entirely. Until now.

With the release of her Reelz documentary Roseanne: Kicked Out of Hollywood, she’s back, spewing her Trump rhetoric and blasting all the haters. The film, which wastes no time making a martyr of the actress, allows Barr to take one final stand against her cancellation. The likes of Mo’Nique, Howie Mandel and her Roseanne executive producer Allan Stephan all participate, offering kind words about their pal while she also defends herself.

For the most part, Barr spends her hour and a half attempting to reconcile her racist tweet aimed at White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. “I shoulda not did it, but by God, I was really pissed that day,” Barr says. Returning to her original defense—the pills made her do it—she continues: “I did something I wouldn’t do if I hadn’t been on that Ambien. It makes you do a lot of crazy shit.”

Roseanne Barr: #MeToo Women are Hos, But Trump is a ‘Deep Thinker’

The original tweet, which resulted in the swift cancellation of the Roseanne reboot, read “muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj” in a response to another tweet about Jarrett. In the doc, Barr and her closest allies unpack the night as it unfolded, starting with her attempting to “do the worst thing” she could do to piss off her producers.

Soon after, Barr received a phone call. Johnny Argent, the star’s longtime boyfriend, recalls hearing her shout, “Racist?! Iran isn’t a fucking race, you fucking idiot!”

Barr says that just 40 minutes after the tweet, her show was canceled. “I was called a racist,” she says in the doc, more upset with the world than herself. “It was politically expedient for them to shit on my name.”

Story continues

Everyone interviewed in the doc continues to use the same excuse: Barr simply thought that Jarrett was white, and the Planet of the Apes comment was about anarchy in the Middle East. Sure. Still, her boyfriend pleads that “there’s not a racist bone in this woman’s body.”

After the tweet was unleashed, Barr attempted to clean up after herself by blaming Ambien, claiming that she didn’t know Jarrett’s race, and demanding to go on The View. But it was no use: Barr would be killed off of her own show, which was later spun into The Conners.

Roseanne Barr’s Daughter on Dealing With Mom’s Affair, Secret Daughter, and Racist Tweet

“Witch-burning is what it is,” Barr says. “Intellectual witch-burning, and arrogance and ignorance. All of the press of the United States and the world, how they interpreted my tweet without any knowledge of the fact that I was sending it to a journalist in Iran about what was happening to the people in Iran. We’re under such terrible censorship. It’s just terrible and frightening.”

As much as Barr would like to pin the dilemma on “witch-burning,” the fact is, her family and coworkers apparently attempted to yank the phone from her grip to get her to stop tweeting. While the comic spent every day of the 2016 election publicly expressing her loyalty to Donald Trump, the production team behind Roseanne would repeatedly tell her to take tweets down.

Roseanne Barr Regrets Apologizing to Valerie Jarrett, Argues Her Tweet Was ‘Not Racist’

“Everyone was begging me to give up my Twitter. Everyone,” Barr recalls. “My kids were trying to lock me out, but I wouldn’t! Because it’s like, I just couldn’t. I’m a goddamn American, I’m not going to do it. I’m a comic, I’m a bad girl, I’m too rock ’n’ roll. I’m going to say fuck it and fuck you ’til I take my last breath.”

Naturally, coming into the writers’ room guns a-blazin’, issues arose around every corner for the staff. Argent claims that the writers’ room “would not accept” Barr’s pro-Trump mentality, and others who worked on the production side claim that she was a “volatile character” and that “a lot of people had a difficult time with her.”

All in all, it definitely sounds like there were many factors leading up to the cancellation of Roseanne and the removal of Barr from her series. Diehard fans, however, shouldn’t worry:Yyou can still catch the comic whining about honey and interviewing staunch conservatives on her free YouTube channel.

Gas station owner ‘on verge of tears’ after undercharging for fuel in Tennessee,"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

Story continues

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

Angry dad’s ‘ugly’ reaction to gender reveal horrifies TikTokers: ‘He’s acting like a 2-year-old’,"In The Know by Yahoo

A dad-to-be was less than thrilled to learn that his wife was pregnant with their third daughter, provoking some strong opinions on the matter.

The footage, originally uploaded by the mom, @kc.fulton, gained over 42 million views on TikTok — but it gained even more traction when it was posted to Twitter by user @notcapnamerica.

Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time a dad has gone viral for throwing a tantrum at a gender reveal party, but considering the backlash this footage has been receiving, it might be the last.

Buried in debt? A financial expert weighs in on how to get back on track

Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this? 🤔 pic.twitter.com/ki3arQ2SgB — chris evans (@notcapnamerica) April 14, 2022

Twitter user @notcapnamerica gained over 10,000 replies when he posted the TikTok video with the caption, “Serious question about these types of videos — what do you think it’s communicating to the other little girls when their dad reacts like this?”

In the video, we see the Fulton family gathered together for a gender reveal photo shoot. With her husband and two daughters by her side, @kc.fulton lifts an umbrella above her head and opens it — showering the family with a flurry of bright pink petals.

As the mom and daughters squeal with delight, Dad angrily shouts and curses, eventually walking out of frame altogether. Eventually, he crosses back into the video, only to cuss angrily again.

“I swear he’s happy,” the caption reads.

‘I think the marriage would be over for me…’

Viewers didn’t hold back in their response to @notcapnamerica‘s question.

“It’s so ugly. I would never post the video,” one Twitter user wrote.

“He’s acting like a 2-year-old. I wouldn’t post this at all. I’d also stop having kids with him too. Babies are blessings. Period,” one user commented.

“I think the marriage would be over for me right at that moment,” another comment read.

“Same vibe with gender reveals when dad jumps up and down and gets excited because, finally, A BOY!!!” wrote another user.

“I hate this. Telling your daughter you don’t want her or [that] she already disappointed you before she was born. Don’t have kids if you are going to continue to burden them with impossible expectations,” replied one user.

“I hope the [baby] that’s coming never sees this. This is awful,” another comment read.

Since going viral, @kc.fulton has disabled comments on the controversial video. But in a follow-up video, she insists that her husband “loves ALL of his girls and they love him.”

“He has loved his babies since the second he found out we were having them! He IS a good dad,” the caption reads.

Let’s hope all three Fulton girls — and every daughter around the world — will be celebrated and loved all their lives.

"I Drank a Gallon of Water Every Day for 30 Days, and This Is What I Learned","Photo credit: vitapix - Getty Images



""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

These days, it seems you can barely go anywhere without hearing about the benefits of staying hydrated, especially as an athlete. And as much as I know that I need to drink a lot of water, staying on top of it just slips my mind. It’s not that I don’t drink any water, it’s just nowhere near a gallon of water a day—I usually drink one 25-ounce bottle and maybe a can of LaCroix.



That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day. However, if you experience any negative side effects—like the ones associated with hyponatremia—slow down your rate of water consumption immediately, Lund advises.

Disappointing photos show what Coachella is like in real life,"Coachella is a popular destination for influencers and Instagram fanatics. Callie Ahlgrim

Coachella in Indio, California, is one of the most famous music festivals.

Insider's music team found the reality was not exactly how it appeared on social media.

It's dusty, the food is expensive, and much of the day is spent sitting or weaving through crowds.

The first taste of the festival is not very picturesque.

The walk from the parking lot is long, tedious, and extremely dusty.

Preferred parking costs $140 plus fees. Callie Ahlgrim

Festival workers try to reduce dust with water, but that often creates mud puddles.

It can take 20 to 30 minutes to reach the festival grounds from single-day parking lots. Callie Ahlgrim

The walk back is even worse.

Most headline performances end well past midnight. Callie Ahlgrim

Many people got lost trying to find their cars and were forced to cut through unmarked areas.

Some people took off their shoes because their feet had become so sore.

Cowboy boots were a popular footwear option at Coachella this year. Callie Ahlgrim

People who are over 21 receive a special wristband that must be renewed each day. Callie Ahlgrim

The line to buy merchandise is especially grueling.

Some people waited for more than two hours to buy merch. Callie Ahlgrim

You could wait 40 minutes or more to buy overpriced food.

This slice of cheese pizza cost $11.

It was OK. Callie Ahlgrim

This order of fries and onion rings cost $26.

The dipping sauces were free. Callie Ahlgrim

There are very few tables and seating areas, so people typically end up eating on the ground.

It's hard to find proper seating at Coachella if you don't have access to VIP areas. Callie Ahlgrim

In fact, people spend far more time sitting on the ground than you might expect.

Shocking images and video capture the burning Russia flagship Moskva before it sank,"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

Monmouth University law class tries to save Armando Galarraga's (almost) perfect game,"It’s one of the most infamous mistakes in sports history.

Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga was denied a perfect game in 2010 when an umpire erroneously ruled that the 27th batter, with two outs in the ninth inning, had beaten a throw to first base.

The umpire and the batter both admitted the call was wrong, but Major League Baseball’s commissioner refused to overturn the umpire’s decision and award Galarraga the 21st perfect game in the sport’s 134-year history. Support to overturn came from the White House, the governor of Michigan and all corners of the media.

Add a new group to that list: 16 members of a Monmouth University “Law and Society” course and their professor, retired New Jersey Superior Court judge Lawrence Jones, have submitted an 82-page document to current MLB commissioner Rob Manfred that makes a case for Galarraga’s addition to the list of perfect games.

Frame grab from Fox Sports Detroit of Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga losing his perfect game when umpire Jim Joyce ruled Cleveland Indians' Jason Donald safe at first base, which would have been the last out of the game, Wednesday, June 2, 2010 at Comerica Park.

Galarraga, who is now retired from baseball and living in Texas, was so touched by the effort that he conducted a Zoom meeting with the students to tell his story and express appreciation.

“It’s amazing, what they’ve done,” he told the Asbury Park Press via phone last week. “I’m floored.”

The point of the project is not just to help Galarraga, although that is certainly its focus.

As Gabriella Griffo, a junior in the course, explained: “It’s about how flexible law really is.”

REWIND: Missed call leaves Detroit's Armando Galarraga one out shy of perfect game

DEBATE: Should baseball give Galarraga his perfect game back?

Monmouth University students (clockwise, from upper left) Antonio Bulzomi, Hannah Latshaw, Gabriella Griffo and Georgia Watkins

'It's about promoting fairness'

Jones, a Toms River resident who remains active in law as a mediator, typically gears the course around a semester-long project. Many of his students are interested in attending law school. Few of them are avid baseball fans, but he saw Galarraga’s story as an ideal topic.

The perfect game is one of the most hallowed achievements in sports — there hasn't been one in 10 years, although Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Clayton Kershaw was on his way there last week before his manager pulled him after seven innings out of concern for his arm.

Story continues

In Galarraga's situation, the classy way he and umpire Jim Joyce handled the mistake provided an enduring lesson in sportsmanship.

Detroit Tigers' Armando Galarraga and Cleveland Indians bench coach Tim Tolman hand the lineups to tearful home plate umpire Jim Joyce, prior to the start of the game Thursday, June 3, 2010 at Comerica Park. Joyce's blown call the night before cost Galarraga a perfect game.

“This was something, when it first happened, that really resonated with millions of people around the globe — people who are not necessarily sports fans, and that was the point,” he said. “When you talk about the intersection between legal principles and social principles, it seemed to me this was a classic case for analysis and discussion. You’re studying how rules are created, how rules are interpreted, principles of fairness and equality — this situation is analogous to so many areas of law.”

Citing both non-baseball case law and examples from Major League Baseball’s past, the students’ document argues that Manfred should exercise his authority to right a blatant wrong.

In baseball terms:

The notion that an umpire’s ruling is final has been dispensed with in the past. In 1983, baseball’s commissioner reversed an umpire’s ruling that Kansas City Royals third baseman George Brett was out because he used too much pine tar on his bat when he hit a home run against the New York Yankees.

Major League Baseball has changed the status of a historical achievement long after the fact. In 1991, Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher Harvey Haddix was removed from the sport’s no-hitter list 32 years after he threw what was classified at the time as a no-hitter. (He had thrown 12 perfect innings, but lost the perfect game on an error and a hit in the 13th inning.)

The institution of instant replay, which occurred in part because of the Galarraga incident, acknowledges that umpires make mistakes that sometimes require correction.

The circumstances surrounding Galarraga’s game are unique enough, including indisputable visual evidence and public agreement by all three parties (pitcher, baserunner, umpire) that the call was wrong, that reversing Joyce’s call won’t open a “can of worms” or create “slippery slope” of future call reversals.

Outside of baseball, the students' document cites court decisions supporting the concept that, to quote a ruling from one case (Westinghouse Electric Corp. v. United Electrical Co., 1946), “a wrong suffered without a remedy is a blot upon the sound administration of justice.”

In other words, getting it right is more important than anything else.

“This is about the spirit of the rule and why rules are created,” said Monmouth junior Antonio Bulzomi, one of the document’s authors. “It’s about promoting fairness.”

Excited for homework

The course took place in the fall semester, the report was delivered to Major League Baseball’s headquarters in February, and if nothing else, it was a valuable experience for participants.

“I never thought advocating could be something like this,” said Hannah Latshaw, a senior from Wall who will pursue a graduate degree in social work. “I always thought about legal terms, not societal terms. This class and this situation has helped us learn to advocate in a much broader spectrum.”

Georgia Watkins, a sophomore in the course who hails from Australia and is a member of Monmouth’s swimming team, said she’d never watched baseball before but became enthralled with the project nonetheless.

“It made you excited to do homework for it, which sounds really nerdy, but I really enjoyed it,” she said. “It made me consider studying law.”

For everyone involved, getting to hear directly from Galarraga was icing on the cake. He not only discussed the game in question, but his journey from Venezuela to America and his graceful response to Joyce’s call.

“You hear that (professional) athletes are condescending and pretentious; he had such an incredible story,” said Griffo, who hails from Plumsted. “It makes the fact that he did not get the perfect game that much more bittersweet.”

Griffo, who captains Monmouth’s Model United Nations team and plans to attend law school and study immigration law, found the experience to be galvanizing.

“To see this overturned would be awesome,” she said.

Galarraga is not expecting that. But he recognizes the big-picture value of the Monmouth students’ quest, one that reaches way beyond sports.

“It’s a great job by them,” he told the Asbury Park Press. “They saw something not right and they want to prove a point. I think that’s good. That’s what leads to progress.”

Gas station owner ‘on verge of tears’ after undercharging for fuel in Tennessee,"For a brief few hours, a convenience store in Tennessee was offering perhaps the lowest fuel prices of any gas station in the country — only the owner didn’t know it.

One customer, Henry DeHart of Chattanooga, knew something was wrong when, after putting 12 gallons of premium gas in the tank of his car, the pump’s digital readout displayed a surprising total: $5.64.

And the price per gallon? Just 45 cents.

With the average cost for a gallon of gas hovering well over $4 — and the price of premium gas in Tennessee at $4.64 a gallon — the deep discount would have been welcome if it wasn’t so clearly a mistake, DeHart said in an April 14 Facebook post.

DeHart went inside to explain the situation to the gas station owner, he said.

A language barrier caused confusion at first, so DeHart asked the owner for his receipt. The dollars and cents on the slip of paper spelled out the problem clearly, and the owner couldn’t hide his pain.

“He ran back around the counter [and] started poking at his screen and then turned green. Nobody had told him in the last 5 hours,” DeHart said.

“There’s no telling how much money he lost today. He was on the verge of tears,” he said.

Gas station owners make a slim profit on gasoline sales, usually about 10 to 15 cents on the gallon, according to the National Association of Convenience Stores. And rising prices hurt their bottom line, as customers become less likely to buy snacks and drinks or other in-store items, which are more profitable than gasoline.

“What I find most frustrating about this is that this man … with the guts to own a small business would get screwed over by people for half of [the] day,” DeHart said.

“How many people this morning thought, it’s my lucky day, while this man was getting taken to the cleaners?” he added.

Not everyone was happy that DeHart had brought their “lucky day” to an end, he said. A man in line behind him made that clear, DeHart said.

“I get it, times are tough and gas is expensive, but NOTHING in this world is free,” DeHart said. “Someone is ultimately always footing the bill.”

DeHart said he paid what he should have owed.

It wasn’t enough to cover the owner’s losses, but “he had already taken such a beating” that it seemed like the right thing to do, DeHart said.

"I Drank a Gallon of Water Every Day for 30 Days, and This Is What I Learned","Photo credit: vitapix - Getty Images



""Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.""

These days, it seems you can barely go anywhere without hearing about the benefits of staying hydrated, especially as an athlete. And as much as I know that I need to drink a lot of water, staying on top of it just slips my mind. It’s not that I don’t drink any water, it’s just nowhere near a gallon of water a day—I usually drink one 25-ounce bottle and maybe a can of LaCroix.



That said, I wanted to know how I’d feel if I really dedicated myself to being the Queen of All Who Are Hydrated, and to see if the benefits you always hear about—things like clearer skin and more energy—are legit.

The best way to hold myself accountable? Take the water challenge: Drinking one gallon of water a day for 30 days straight with the hope that I’d want to keep going even after the month was up.

But a gallon of water a day seemed like a lot, and I’d heard stories about the dangers of drinking too much water too quickly, so I reached out to Nicole Lund, M.S., R.D.N., clinical nutritionist at NYU Langone Health’s Sports Performance Center, to see what I should know before I started.



Lund told me that as long as I spread it out throughout the day and didn’t chug a gallon in one sitting, there wasn’t really too much to worry about. But she did warn me about a condition called hyponatremia, which is when there’s an abnormally low amount of sodium in your blood. It can happen if you drink way too much water and don’t take in enough sodium, and it could lead to nausea, vomiting, headache, fatigue, and—more seriously—seizure, respiratory arrest, or even brain damage.

“This is a rare occurrence seen mainly in cases of extreme over-hydration and excessive salty sweating by endurance athletes,” Lund says. So I made sure to heed her advice, hydrate throughout the day, and take in enough sodium through my diet along the way.

With Lund’s words of wisdom in the back of my mind, I began my quest for better hydration, and I learned a lot. Here are the most important takeaways I noticed.

→ Get Bicycling All Access for the latest cycling and health tips!

1. I went to the bathroom—a lot.

I expected this going in, but assuming you’ll pee every 20 minutes and actually doing so are two different things. This is because your body flushes out the water it doesn’t actually need. I kind of got used to my frequent bathroom trips, but I’d be lying if I said the whole thing wasn’t annoying on some level. For example, there were times I was really in the zone at work, but my bladder was screaming at me to get up and pee, which interrupted my focus. The upside to this was that it forced me to get up and move more, so I guess I can’t really complain.

I was initially worried that this urge to pee would sabotage my workouts and my sleep, but thankfully, I was always too focused on the workout to even realize I had to pee, and while I woke up a few times in the beginning to go to the bathroom, my body eventually adjusted, and I slept through the night.

When it came to life outside exercise and work, I felt a little self-conscious constantly excusing myself to go to the bathroom during dinners and drinks with friends, but most of them knew that I had committed myself to drinking a gallon of water a day anyway, so they understood.



2. I snacked less throughout the day.

Usually in the hour or two after eating lunch, I get hungry again. So I turn to the office vending machine for a solution. While it stocks healthier options than a regular vending machine (like dark chocolate peanut butter cups instead of Reese’s), I still feel like it’s not the best option.

But because water takes up space in your stomach and made me feel full or generally less hungry, the result? For the most part, I stopped ravenously munching on everything I could get my hands on between lunch and dinner.

Overall, I started to become more in tune with how my body worked and was able to really listen to what it was telling me. I became aware of the times of day where I felt more hungry and was able to figure out why that might be. So if I felt like I needed a snack or a little something extra to get me through the day, I allowed myself to have it.

3. I had more energy.

This perk was an unexpected one. While I’ve heard and read that upping your water intake translates into a noticeable energy boost, I never quite believed it. I was one of those people who needed that afternoon cup of coffee (in addition to my morning one)—I didn’t want to chance nodding off at my desk.

But about two weeks into my challenge, I surprised myself by declining to join a few of my coworkers for our usual afternoon trip to Starbucks. Why? I just didn’t feel like I needed it. For the first time in what felt like forever, I wasn’t completely exhausted by the time 2 p.m. rolled around.

“Water plays a large role in how our bodies function and the health of our metabolism,” Lund says. “Even in the early stages of dehydration, one can experience fatigue and diminished exercise capacity due to increased body temperature, increased respiration rate, increased pulse, and increased perception of effort.”

4. It got easier.

On day one of the challenge, I honestly thought there was no way I’d be able to do this. Five 25-ounce water bottles a day? Yikes. I was especially worried about not being able to hit the amount on weekends, since I’m usually out and about—not just sitting at my desk with a water bottle right in front of me.

In the beginning, I created the following chart to stick to in order to make sure I was drinking enough:

7:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.: Drink bottle 1

10:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 2

1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 3

4:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 4

7:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.: Drink bottle 5

Five 25-ounce bottles got me to just under a gallon, so I made sure to sip a little extra throughout the day. But it really only took less than a week for me to get used to this new normal. I stopped having to force myself to follow the chart I made and think about how many bottles I had to drink each day and at what times—I just did it.

Even now, after this challenge has “officially” ended, I write this while sipping from my third bottle of the day. And while I might not hold myself to super strict standards of drinking exactly a gallon, I definitely think I’ve created a good habit of being conscious about staying hydrated.

Should you try drinking a gallon of water a day, too?

It’s especially important for athletes to stay properly hydrated, since “performance can start to decline with as little as 2 to 3 percent bodyweight loss from sweat,” Lund says. And while there’s really no “one-size-fits-all” hydration approach, it’s generally fine for most people to consume a gallon of water a day.

Shocking images and video capture the burning Russia flagship Moskva before it sank,"The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of thick black smoke billowing upward.

The Pentagon confirmed that the Moskva sunk after being hit with a Ukrainian missile.

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500.

New images show the Russian warship Moskva burning shortly before it sank into the Black Sea.

The images and video show the ship tilting to its port side with large plumes of black smoke billowing upward. Experts say the photos and video are of the Moskva, according to the Guardian, but their origin is unknown.

The Pentagon confirmed last week that Ukrainian forces sank the Moskva with at least one Neptune anti-sink missile on Thursday, lending credence to Ukrainian forces' version of events.

Russia and Ukraine agree that the Moskva was damaged after ammunition detonated on board, but have different accounts of what led to the ship's sinking. Russian officials claimed the ammunition exploded due to a fire on board whose cause was being investigated, while Ukrainian officials said it had struck the Moskva with Neptune anti-ship missiles causing ""serious damage.""

The Moskva weighed 12,000 tons and was more than 600 feet long, with a crew of 500. The sinking of the warship named for the Russian capital is a huge blow to Russian morale, and is unlikely to be easily explained away by Russian officials to their population.

Russia's defense ministry claimed on April 14 that all crew members had been evacuated from the ship, and the Pentagon saw Russian sailors leaving the damaged ship in lifeboats, according to the Washington Post. But the mother of one surviving sailor told the Novaya Gazeta Europe that about 40 people had died during the incident and many were wounded and missing, the Post reported.

""There are dead, there are wounded, there are missing. My son called me when they were given phones. They left their documents and [their personal] phones on the [ship]. He calls me and cries from what he saw. It was scary. It is clear that not everyone survived,"" the anonymous mother said.

How Donald Trump Gets Away With Paying Less Income Tax Than Joe Biden,"President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden released their income tax returns last week. The first couple reported $610,702 in adjusted gross income and paid $150,439 in federal income tax at an effective tax rate of 24.6%.

While it’s unclear what former president Donald Trump’s income or tax bill was for 2021, we can compare Biden’s 2017 federal tax return with the data The New York Times reported on regarding Trump’s income tax payment in 2017.

Biden’s 2017 tax return showed $11,031,309 in adjusted gross income and a federal tax payment of $3,553,249. The New York Times reported that Trump only paid $750 in federal income taxes that year, the same as he paid in 2016.

According to The New York Times, the former president’s various businesses lost hundreds of millions of dollars over the previous 20 years, allowing him to reduce his federal tax obligation to almost nothing.

Benzinga hasn’t seen Trump’s tax returns and cannot verify the facts reported by the Times. However, assumptions can be made based on Trump’s largest business venture - his real estate holdings.

Real Estate Tax Benefits

Real estate offers some unique tax advantages, mainly the ability to write off depreciation against income. In fact, it’s quite common for a real estate investor to show a loss on their income tax return while actually receiving positive cash flow for the year.

This tax strategy can be seen across almost all equity real estate investment trusts (REITs). For example, Piedmont Office Realty Trust (NYSE: PDM) reported a net loss of nearly $1.2 million for 2021, which included a $120.6 million expense for depreciation and amortization. The company’s actual funds from operations (FFO) was $245.4 million.

While the company’s tax returns showed a loss, it was actually able to pay out over $104 million to its shareholders for the year in dividends.

Another likely reason for Trump’s low tax bills is the use of a tax loss carryforward. Companies, such as The Trump Organization, can carry losses over from one year to offset taxes in subsequent years. Trump used this strategy after realizing nearly $1 billion in losses in the early 90s. He was able to carry those losses over each year until 2005.

Joe Biden’s 2017 income, on the other hand, was mainly earned through speaking engagements and book deals, neither of which offers the same tax advantages as real estate.

How Individuals Use This Tax Strategy

Individual real estate investors use Trump’s tax strategy every year, which is one reason real estate is such a popular asset class. Investors can even take advantage of these tax benefits without having to purchase a skyscraper, hotel or apartment complex themselves.

Passive investments as a limited partner through private equity real estate deals can provide many of the same benefits. Investors that take part in a direct real estate investment through a crowdfunded offering will receive a K-1 tax document each year, which shows the investor’s share of net income, or loss, after deducting expenses like depreciation.

It’s not uncommon for investors to receive cash distributions throughout the year, then be able to show a loss on their tax returns.

It’s important to understand that each individual’s situation is different when it comes to income taxes and not all private equity real estate investments have the same pass-through tax structure. It’s always a good idea to consult with a certified public accountant to determine how a particular investment will affect your unique tax situation.

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks,"How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stocks at a profit, you will owe taxes on those gains. Depending on how long you’ve owned the stock, you may owe at your regular income tax rate or at the capital gains rate, which is usually lower than the former. To pay taxes you owe on stock sales, use IRS Form 8949 and Schedule D. A financial advisor who serves your area can help you with tax planning for your investments and retirement.

The Basics on How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

If you sell stock for less you bought it for, you won’t owe any income tax on the losses. In fact, you may be able to use this loss to reduce your taxes. If you sell stock for more than you paid, however, you’ll have a profit and may need to pay taxes on that gain.

If you’ve owned the stock for less than a year before selling it at a profit, you’ll owe taxes on it at your regular income tax rate. If you owned the stocks for more than a year, the long-term capital gains tax rates apply. These rates are dependent on your overall income, but may be 0%, 15% or 20%.

You can use SmartAsset’s capital gains calculator to estimate the taxes you’ll owe. The calculator can also figure the estimated capital gains taxes on profits from sales of other assets, such as real estate, collectibles and cryptocurrency.

A basic strategy for reducing taxes on stock sale profits is to hold stocks that have appreciated since purchase for at least a year before selling them. This ensures profits on stock sales will be taxed at the usually lower capital gains rate. Another approach is to sell stocks that have declined in value in order to generate a loss that can be used to shelter gains.

Note that whether you owe income taxes at your regular rate or the capital gains rate, you don’t owe Social Security or Medicare taxes on gain from sales of stocks. Investment income, including profits from stock sales as well as dividends and interest, is considered passive income and does not pay these taxes. However, passive income is subject to federal, state and local income taxes.

Using IRS Form 8949 to Pay Taxes on Your Stocks

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Whether you show a profit or a loss, you’ll report stock sales on IRS Form 8949. This is the tax form used for reporting sales or exchanges of any capital assets not reported elsewhere. The information about stock sales needed on your Form 8949 should come from a Form 1099-B issued by the brokerage you are using. This will identify the stock, the dates it was acquired and sold, the sale price and cost of the stock, the profit or loss and any federal or state income taxes that were withheld. The IRS and state taxing authorities will also get a copy of the 1099-B. If you don’t get a 1099-B from your brokerage for some reason, use your own records to fill out Form 8949.

Form 8949 has two parts. The first is for short-term transactions on assets held less than a year. To fill out each part, on the first line enter the information for each stock you sold under the appropriate column. You’ll provide the stock name and number of shares, purchase and sale dates, sale price, cost and profit or loss.

You won’t usually need to enter anything in the columns for adjustments. See the instructions for Form 8949 for details. At the bottom of the form total the amounts in the columns for sale price, cost and profit or loss.

On the second part of the form, enter the same information for sales of assets held for more than a year.

Filling Out Schedule D

Schedule D is one of the schedules that are part of Form 1040. After filling out Form 8949, taxpayers transfer the totals to Schedule D. From this they can generate the overall gain or loss from stock transactions.

Like Form 8949, Schedule D also separates transactions into long- and short-term gains. The difference is still based on whether the asset was owned for a year or less.

The totals from Schedule D get transferred to the taxpayer’s 1040 on line 7. Also, any tax that the brokerage withheld when the stock was sold will be reported on Form 1040. You can learn more from the IRS instructions for Schedule D.

Bottom Line

How to Pay Taxes on Stocks

Investors who buy and sell stocks will reports the gains and losses to the IRS on Form 1040 using Form 8949 and Schedule D. These forms separate stock sale profits into long- and short-term capital gains. The difference between them is that long-term gains are taxed at the potentially lower capital gains rate, while investors pay taxes on short-term gains at their regular tax rates, which are usually higher.

Tax Planning Tips

Crafting a tax-efficient strategy to make the most of your investment gains can benefit from the assistance of a financial advisor. Finding a qualified financial advisor doesn’t have to be hard. SmartAsset’s free tool matches you with up to three financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you.

Column: Spieth crossing $50M a reminder of Tiger's standard,"Not even inflation can diminish the dominance of Tiger Woods.

The latest reminder came at Hilton Head when Jordan Spieth overcame an 18-inch miss on Saturday and a three-shot deficit on Sunday to beat Patrick Cantlay in a playoff for his 13th career PGA Tour victory.

Along with a tartan jacket (he looks better in green) and a spot in the winners-only field at Kapalua next January (a big perk to him), Spieth earned $1,440,000. That made him the 11th player in PGA Tour history to cross the $50 million mark in career earnings.

Officially, he is the youngest player at 28 years and 9 months to reach $50 million.

That's where inflation comes in.

Woods is the only other player to reach $50 million in career tour earnings before turning 30. He was 29 and 6 months when he was runner-up at the Western Open in 2005, pushing him over a milestone that he quickly left in the rearview mirror.

Woods needed only seven more years to cross $100 million, and now he is at $120,895,206.

Spieth was among a half-dozen players who inconspicuously leaned over the railing from the second floor of PGA Tour headquarters last month to watch as Woods was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame. He would be quick to acknowledge that a number like $50 million wouldn't even exist without Woods.

Yes, there was a significant difference in purses.

Total prize money when Woods turned pro in the summer of 1996 was $65.95 million. Spieth turned pro in 2013 — like Woods, without a tour card — and the total prize fund was $260 million.

While both reached $50 million in roughly nine years, Woods did it in 41 fewer tournaments (177 compared with 218 for Spieth). The average total prize money for Woods during that stretch was $173.8 million. For Spieth, it was $322.56 million.

Rory McIlroy is a better comparison. He turned pro nearly six years before Spieth and has kept a global schedule with membership on two tours. McIlroy needed only 173 events on the PGA Tour to reach $50 million at Bay Hill in 2020, about six weeks before he turned 31.

Story continues

Scores are coming down and prize money is going up. Such is the evolution of sport. The best measure will always be victories.

Woods has 82 on the PGA Tour alone — 11 more on tours in Asia, Australia, Japan and Europe — and 15 majors. Those are the numbers that define him. When he passed $50 million, Woods already had 43 tour victories.

Money still matters, though not entirely to Woods. He was asked at Riviera a few months ago if he knew how much was in his deferred compensation package.

“Nope. Uh-uh,” he said.

Does he want to know?

“Uh-uh,” he said.

Still, this can be added to his long list of feats that might never be matched, right up there with 142 consecutive cuts and needing only seven starts to qualify for the Tour Championship.

Woods has been atop the PGA Tour career money list for 22 years.

It used to be a contest. Greg Norman took the lead over Tom Kite in August 1995 by winning the World Series of Golf at Firestone, and he kept it until the last week in January 2000 when Davis Love III moved past him after the Phoenix Open.

Love stayed on top all of two weeks until Woods was runner-up at Torrey Pines and took over. It took 73 tournaments from his “Hello, world” introduction to Woods leading the career money list, and the gap has only widened.

Spieth is not ready to declare himself all the way back — “close but far” is what he said after he won the RBC Heritage. He has two wins in just over a year, but also seven finishes out of the top 25 since winning the Texas Open last year and three missed cuts this year.

He will always be compared with how he started his career.

It was at the Valspar Championship in 2015 when Spieth, then 21 and in his third year, played a practice round with three others born the same year — Justin Thomas, Daniel Berger and Ollie Schniederjans. They lined up for a group photo from oldest to youngest, sharing birthdates to make sure they got it right. Spieth was the youngest.

This was one week after he passed $9 million in career money.

Spieth went on to win five times that year, including the Masters and U.S. Open, missing the British Open playoff by one shot and finishing second in the PGA Championship. He had a 60% rate finishing in the top 10 and set a PGA Tour record with $12,030,465 in earnings.

Woods in 2000 won nine times, including three majors. He was runner-up four times and only finished out of the top 10 three times in 20 starts. He made $9,188,321 that year.

The money keeps going up. The Players Championship paid $3.6 million to the winner — the total purse was $3.5 million the first year Woods played.

Is it enough for anyone to catch Woods?

McIlroy, who turns 33 in two weeks, is just over $59 million behind. Spieth is $70 million back, and not quite $4 million ahead of his contemporary, Justin Thomas. Dustin Johnson has just over $74 million in career earnings. He turns 38 in June.

Even with today's money, they all seem so far away. Just like always.

John Daly’s son — who has played one college golf tournament — signs NIL deal with Hooters,"John Daly II has played exactly one tournament for the University of Arkansas and posted just a single round under par during that event, but that didn’t stop the freshman from signing a name, image, likeness deal with Hooters, an agreement that was announced on Tuesday.

The son of two-time major champ John Daly played in one tournament last fall for the Razorbacks, posting scores of 83-68-78 at the Blessings Collegiate Invitational in October.

The Dalys combined in December to win the PNC Championship at the Ritz-Carlton Golf Club in Orlando, using a 36-hole total of 27-under 117 to beat Tiger and Charlie Woods. In the process, the tandem broke the previous tournament scoring record set by Davis Love III/Dru Love in 2018 by one stroke, and earned Team Daly the red-leather Willie Park winner’s belts.

Hooters has signed father-son duo John Daly and John Daly II in its first NIL agreement for a college athlete. The Dalys will promote the world-famous @Hooters brand through various marketing activities, including significant roles on social media and other digital channels. pic.twitter.com/gN2SKOP0KX — Kristi Dosh (@SportsBizMiss) April 19, 2022

Also, the younger Daly placed T-12 in the 2022 New Year’s Invitational at St. Petersburg Country Club, posting rounds of 69 and 68 in the process. That event was won by Remi Chartier of East Tennessee State. The freshman from Clearwater has seen little time in the Arkansas lineup as stars Mateo Fernández de Oliveira and Luke Long have led the way. The Razorbacks won the SEC Match Play Championship in the fall at Shoal Creek, and currently sit at No. 11 in the Golfweek/Sagarin collegiate team rankings.

The senior Daly said via Twitter that he was happy to continue the family relationship with the brand.

Story continues

“Can’t express how excited I am to be back with my @Hooters family & having my son beside me on the next generation!” he said.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed.

“Hooters is thrilled to make our long-standing relationship with John official and to enter an exciting new venture with Little John as our first NIL ambassador,” Bruce Skala, Hooters senior VP of marketing, said in a release. “John’s larger-than-life personality makes him an ideal representative of Hooters’ fun-loving spirit, while Little John will promote our brand to the next generation as one of the next big names in golf. We are ecstatic to have the Dalys, fantastic golfers and great personalities, on board as spokespeople for Hooters, the definitive 19th hole.”

NIL deals continue to make news as the stakes for college athletes is raised. For example, a five-star high school recruit in the 2023 class recently signed a name, image and likeness collective with a school that could earn him $8 million before his senior year at the college, The Athletic reported.

Since the Supreme Court upheld a lower court’s decision in June 2021 that threw out the NCAA’s restrictions on “education-related benefits,” almost 30 states have passed legislation about NIL and its governance, despite being no federal law to oversee it.

The NCAA is expected to file a report to discuss how NIL is impacting college athletics, despite the Supreme Court ruling that “the NCAA is not above the law” in its unanimous decision.

Former Vikings QB leads team to win in USFL debut,"There were plenty of familiar faces kick-starting the festivities over the weekend in the season-opening week of the USFL. One of those faces was former Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kyle Sloter.

As the leading signal caller for the New Orleans Breakers, Sloter stepped under center on Sunday and helped lead the team to a 23-17 win over the Philadelphia Stars.

Granted, the team was carried by the defense for the most part with linebacker Vontae Diggs snatching a pick-six early in the ballgame. The team also leaned heavily on the legs of running back Jordan Ellis, along with the versatile playmaking abilities of T.J. Logan Jr.

Sloter, who was actually signed to the Vikings’ active roster last December, went 17-of-27 passing for 150 yards and one interception. So it wasn’t necessarily the big coming-out-party he hoped it would be. But the outcome played out in his favor, and he can look forward to improving in his next outing.

The 28-year-old quarterback played for six different teams during his time in the NFL, including two pit stops in Minnesota.

At the very least, it’s a positive turn of events seeing a former journeyman get some well-deserved shine as a starter in a new league.

"Brunson scores 41, Mavs make 22 3s in Game 2 win vs Jazz","DALLAS (AP) — Jalen Brunson, Maxi Kleber and the Dallas Mavericks got even in their first-round playoff series with a bunch of a 3-pointers, their fewest turnovers ever in a postseason game, and without injured superstar Luka Doncic.

Brunson scored a career-high 41 points, Maxi Kleber had 25 with eight of their playoff-record 22 made 3-pointers and the Mavericks, with only three turnovers, beat the Utah Jazz 110-104 in Game 2 on Monday night.

In danger of dropping the first two games after opening the playoffs with home-court advantage for the first time since their NBA title 11 years ago, the Mavericks even overcame a 10-point deficit after halftime.

Kleber, who had made only 19% of his 3-point attempts since the All-Star break, was 8-of-11 from beyond the arc and put the Mavs ahead to stay with 4:21 left, then added another 3 on the next possession.

“I started this morning, I was talking to (Dorian Finney-Smith) and I told him, ‘Doe, I’m going to let 10 3s fly tonight.’ And he said, ‘That’s my dog.’ And that kind of set the tone for the day,” Kleber said. “The mindset is we know they’re going to leave certain guys open to shoot. We’ve just got to let it fly.”

Game 3 is Thursday night in Utah, where Dallas has lost its last 11 games.

“We did what we had to do, which was win tonight. But we were only focused on tonight,” Mavericks coach Jason Kidd said. “We understand what’s in front of us, what’s coming. It’s going to be a hostile environment.”

Brunson, the starting point guard with Doncic out, became the fifth Dallas player to score 40 points in a playoff game. He is the first Mavericks player to do that without committing a turnover. The other 40-point scorers were Doncic, Dirk Nowitzki, Rolando Blackman and Nick Van Exel.

Donovan Mitchell had 34 points for Utah, while Bojan Bogdanovic had 25 and Jordan Clarkson 21. Rudy Gobert had eight points and 17 rebounds.

“We tried to go out there and take both (games). Didn’t happen. You know we’re not going to overreact. We’re going to go home, and we’ve got to take care of business. Simple as that,” Mitchell said. “At the end of the day, we’re happy we took a game and go back and take care of business.”

Story continues

Dallas had led only once in the second half until a 10-0 run capped by a go-ahead 3 by Finney-Smith and a jumper by Brunson. Royce O'Neale then hit a tying 3-pointer and Mitchell made a short jumper to put Utah back in front before Kleber's back-to-back 3s.

""The telltale is we can’t have Brunson have the night he had and also be able to kick the ball out for those looks,” Jazz coach Quin Snyder said. “And when those passes are kicked out, I thought we weren’t as sharp mentally in our ability to rotate. And that’s something that we’ve done before.”

Doncic was still out because of a strained left calf he suffered in the regular season finale eight days earlier. Kidd said before the game that the 23-year-old All-Star was making progress, “definitely going in the right direction” and doing more each day.

Brunson, who had 24 points when the Mavs lost 99-93 in Game 1, made his first five shots — with three 3s — in the first 6 minutes.

“I’m just playing how the defense is giving me, just seeing how they’re defending certain things. Just stepping into certain shots,” Brunson said. “Yeah, the 5-of-5 start is great, but I had the same mentality when I was 0 for 5 last game, or whatever. ... You can’t fluctuate whenever, not even when (Doncic) is in or out. Because you need guys to make plays.”

TIP-INS

Jazz: Utah wiped out a five-point deficit in the final minute of of the first quarter to tie the game at 24. The sequence started with Gobert’s putback dunk. The 7-foot-1 center, the NBA’s top defensive player three of the previous four seasons who finished third for this season’s award announced earlier Monday, then had a block before a 3 from Clarkson, who initially was tripped up moving through the lane before getting up and getting the ball back in the corner.

Mavericks: The Mavs finished 21 of 41 on 3s (51.2%) and shot 50% overall (36 of 72). ... Spencer Dinwiddie had all three Dallas turnovers, two on plays that could have easily been fouls against Utah. He had 17 points and six assists. ... Dallas led the NBA during the regular season with 17 wins after coming back from deficits of at least 10 points.

SAME DRAFT

Brunson, whose previous high was 34 points during his rookie season, is in the final year of his rookie deal and is unsigned past this season. The former NCAA championship guard at Villanova was drafted in 2018, the same year as Doncic.

“He’s going to make a lot of money. I don’t know if he needs an agent, but I’ll put my name in the hat,” Kidd said, apparently not aware that Brunson has the same agent as Doncic. ""It’s not just what he did tonight. It’s not what he’s going to do going forward. He’s already done the work. He’s showing that he deserves to be paid. He does his job at a very high level, and he’s a winner.

MLB DFS Picks Today (4/19/22): Spotlight Pitchers & Top Stacks Tuesday,"Tuesday, April 19, brings a robust 10-game main slate with a first pitch time of 7:10 p.m. ET on Yahoo, DraftKings and FanDuel.

As always, you can head over to the Awesemo MLB DFS & Fantasy Baseball home page for all the fantasy baseball content you need for any given slate.

MLB DFS Picks Today: Spotlight Pitchers and Top Stacks | Tuesday, April 19

Yahoo Stack of the Day: Boston Red Sox vs. LHP Yusei Kikuchi — 5.0 implied runs

Yesterday the Red Sox lost the early-morning Patriot’s Day game, but they should bounce back tonight in a tasty matchup against lefty Yusei Kikuchi. The former Mariner can be exploited by right-handed hitting, which is something that Boston brings to this matchup. Trevor Story ($15) and Bobby Dalbec ($9) are steals on Yahoo tonight, along with J.D. Martinez ($18), Xander Bogaerts ($17) and Enrique “Kike” Hernandez ($17). This will be a popular stack, though there are plenty of other ways to find roster differentiation with a 20-team player pool.

Late Slate: Oakland Athletics vs. Baltimore Orioles — 4.3 implied runs

The Orioles have not yet announced a starter for tonight, so we could be looking at a bullpen game — or a minor league callup. Either way, the longer the uncertainty lasts, the longer the Athletics will stay under the radar. Somehow, Oakland is tied for the league lead with 58 runs scored, putting it in the same lofty tier as the Dodgers. There will be regression at some point, as half of the A’s lineup consists of replacement-level players, but until that happens, we need to follow the infamous words of Crash Davis and “Respect the streak.” Sean Murphy and Seth Brown are the above-average options, and then players such as Billy McKinney, Elvis Andrus and Tony Kemp can be feathered in for differentiation. There is no need to go overboard with four- or five-man stacks, but using duos and trios from the Athletics does provide some discounted upside potential on all slates.

Spotlight Pitchers

Top MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Corbin Burnes vs. Pittsburgh Pirates — 2.9 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $58 | FanDuel $10,800 | DraftKings $10,500

Yahoo has broken its soft pitching salary cap of $55 for the reigning National League Cy Young winner Corbin Burnes. The matchup against a watered-down Pirates squad is one of the best any pitcher will get this season. There will be enough discount dandies finding their way into lineups tonight that employing Burnes as an ace should not be an issue. Through two starts, Burnes has logged a dozen innings with as many strikeouts, allowing just three earned runs. Over the last two seasons, the projected Pittsburgh lineup has been dreadful against right-handed hurlers, with a 0.272 wOBA, 0.068 ISO and a 6.0% walk rate. Enjoy!

Secondary MLB DFS Picks Target: RHP Joe Musgrove vs. Cincinnati Reds — 3.2 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $50 | FanDuel $11,000 | DraftKings $8,600

The DraftKings salary algorithm is giving a nice discount for Joe Musgrove in a matchup against a patchwork Cincinnati squad. FanDuel went a little overboard, though; with its loose salaries, it is not too difficult to roster Musgrove. The Reds are without Nick Castellanos, Jesse Winker and Eugenio Suarez, who are all playing for new teams. Mike Moustakas is day-to-day with an arm injury, and Tyler Naquin was placed on the injured list Monday. That means Joey Votto will be the lone above-average lefty in the lineup with Jake Fraley and Colin Moran likely joining him, along with their elevated strikeout rates. In his last 117 same-handed matchups, Aristides Aquino has struck out 48.7% of the time. While Tommy Pham rolled up a three-hit game against his former squad last night, including a double and a home run, his best days are well behind him. Things are looking good for Musgrove tonight, and he should be rostered with confidence.

Wild Card MLB DFS Picks Target: LHP Cole Irvin vs. Baltimore Orioles — 3.7 implied runs

DFS Salary: Yahoo $29 | FanDuel $7,100 | DraftKings $6,300

Today’s wild card is lefty Cole Irvin, who has both an appealing matchup and salary on Yahoo and DraftKings, where two pitchers are required for each lineup. Baltimore does project to put in nearly a full complement of right-handed hitters against Irving tonight, and while it do have above-average power (.207 ISO) that comes with a lot of strikeout (25.7%) upside. While Irvin has below-average strikeout stuff, he has solid control allowing very few walks and extra-base hits. When looking to a low-upside pitcher like Irvin, it is important to also account for how the salary relief he provides can be employed across the remainder of the lineup.

Final MLB DFS Thoughts & Weather Notes for the Tuesday, April 19 Fantasy Baseball Slate

Tuesday brings a brief respite from the precipitation we saw on Monday. Most outdoor venues in the Midwest and East Coast are still experiencing cold and likely will for the next two or three weeks. The White Sox at Guardians game in Cleveland was postponed, though with the 6:10 p.m. ET start time it was not represented on many Tuesday slates.

Please believe me when I tell you that I do not hate your team.
1. Los Angeles Dodgers
Record: 8-2
Last Week: 3
It’s quite fitting that Freddie Freeman connected for his first Dodgers home run in his first at-bat of the night Monday against the visiting Braves. The solo shot to left-center put Los Angeles up 1-0 in the bottom of the first, and Freeman also scored a run following a walk in the bottom of the fourth. All part of a 7-4 victory, the Dodgers’ seventh straight victory since they lost two games at Colorado’s Coors Field over opening weekend. This team is stacked with talent and now fully hitting its stride.
2. Toronto Blue Jays
Record: 6-4
Last Week: 1
There’s no shame in being leapfrogged by the streaking Dodgers. Toronto has yet to lose a series this season, having taken two of three from the Rangers to open things up, then splitting a four-game set at Yankee Stadium, before grabbing another two of three against the A’s over the weekend. Teoscar Hernandez will be sorely missed as he recovers from a left oblique strain. The 29-year-old has batted .295/.347/.538 with 49 homers and 153 RBI in 199 games since the beginning of 2020.
3. New York Mets
Record: 7-3
Last Week: 4
Tylor Megill will take the bump in the first half of Tuesday’s doubleheader versus the Giants following a rainout in Queens on Monday. Essentially the fill-in for Jacob deGrom, Megill has looked very deGrom-like in the early going with a 0.00 ERA, 0.58 WHIP, and 11/0 K/BB ratio in two starts covering 10 1/3 innings. Francisco Lindor is well on his way to a big-time fantasy bounceback, boasting a 1.048 OPS with three homers, seven RBI, two steals, and nine runs scored in 10 games.

4. Chicago White Sox
Record: 6-3
Last Week: 5
Already looking like a runaway favorite in the AL Central, the White Sox have won all three of their series so far against the Tigers, Mariners, and Rays. Dylan Cease, the defacto ace with Lance Lynn (knee) and Lucas Giolito (abdomen) on the shelf, is 2-0 with a 1.69 ERA and 16 strikeouts over 10 2/3 innings. Tim Anderson has batted .393 with a 1.021 OPS through 29 plate appearances since missing the first two games of the year due to a suspension stemming from a late-2021 dustup.
5. Atlanta Braves
Record: 5-7
Last Week: 2
A little bit of panic for the reigning World Series champions, who began the year as the No. 1 team in these rankings and are now barely clinging to a top-five spot. The bottom-third of the lineup is badly struggling, most notably Dansby Swanson. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts in Monday night’s loss to the Dodgers and is 6-for-42 (.141) with 20 whiffs through 12 games to begin the year. The good news is that Ronald Acuña (knee) appears set to begin a rehab assignment on Tuesday.
6. Houston Astros
Record: 6-4
Last Week: 6
Yordan Alvarez returned Monday from a week-long absence due to illness and sure looked to be back at peak health, going 3-for-5 with a pair of 420-foot home runs and a fourth-inning single that came off his bat 109.6 mph. His four-RBI night helped the Astros to a decisive 8-3 win over the division-rival Angels. The 24-year-old masher is sporting a 1.153 OPS through his first 22 plate appearances this season. For his career, he’s averaging 42 homers and 129 RBI in every 162 games played.
7. Milwaukee Brewers
Record: 6-5
Last Week: 7
Christian Yelich hit his first home run of the year, a fourth-inning grand slam, as the Brewers cruised to a 6-1 victory against the Pirates on Monday in Milwaukee. Including his results from the Cactus League this spring, it was the first time that Yelich had gone deep since September 24, 2021. Eric Lauer got the start on Monday, working six innings of one-run ball, and now Pittsburgh will have to contend with Corbin Burnes and Brandon Woodruff in the final two games of the three-game set.
8. New York Yankees
Record: 5-5
Last Week: 9
It came in a late 5-0 loss to the Orioles, but Nestor Cortes struck out 12 batters over five scoreless innings on Sunday, becoming the first pitcher in Yankees franchise history to record 12-plus strikeouts in five frames or fewer. Including his strong season debut on April 12 against a dangerous Blue Jays team, the 27-year-old left-hander holds a 0.00 ERA and 17/1 K/BB ratio in 9 1/3 innings to begin the 2022 campaign. He’s lined up for a showdown versus the visiting Guardians this Saturday.
9. Tampa Bay Rays
Record: 5-6
Last Week: 8
Wander Franco was scratched from the Rays’ lineup on Monday at Wrigley Field, though manager Kevin Cash did tell reporters after the game -- a 4-2 loss for Tampa Bay -- that his star shortstop could be ready to return as early as Tuesday. Injuries have already wreaked havoc on the pitching side of the depth chart, with Shane Baz, Luis Patino, Tyler Glasnow, Yonny Chirinos, Brendan McKay, Nick Anderson, and Pete Fairbanks currently on the 60-day IL. Ryan Yarbrough is on the 10-day IL.
10. San Francisco Giants
Record: 7-2
Last Week: 14
The reigning NL West champs are on a five-game winning streak after their weekend sweep at Cleveland. San Francisco’s pitching staff currently holds the lowest combined ERA in the majors at 2.20. And has Brandon Belt’s late-career surge drawn enough praise? The veteran first baseman struck a two-run homer in Sunday’s rout of the Guardians and carries a .996 OPS (169 OPS+) with 41 home runs and 96 RBI in 155 games since the beginning of the delayed and condensed 2020 season.
11. San Diego Padres
Record: 7-5
Last Week: 12
Sean Manaea tossed six innings of one-run ball and Manny Machado slugged his second home run of the year as the Padres sailed to a 4-1 win over the visiting Reds on Monday night at Petco Park. Taylor Rogers, an Opening Day addition from the Twins, closed that one out for his NL-leading fifth save. And here’s a fun note: San Diego is the first team in MLB history to go 12 games without an error to begin a season. Sharp all-around play has put the Friars in solid position here in mid-April.
12. Philadelphia Phillies
Record: 4-7
Last Week: 10
Philly has lost six of its last seven games versus the Mets, Marlins, and Rockies. And there is heightened concern around Bryce Harper, who is currently limited to DH duties because of tendinitis in his right (throwing) elbow. “Get treatment on it and try to get through it,” the 29-year-old outfielder said of the ailment on Monday. “I’ve never had arm problems in my life, so this is very new to me. Just trying to feel it out and see what happens.” That certainly seems like something to monitor.
13. Boston Red Sox
Record: 5-5
Last Week: 11
Patriots’ Day is supposed to be a celebratory event in New England. The improving weather, the Boston Marathon, the early start time at Fenway Park. But the 2022 edition of that regional holiday will not be remembered so fondly after the Red Sox fell 8-3 to the visiting Twins. Rich Hill got the start on Monday and gave up four earned runs over 4 2/3 innings while watching his early-season ERA rise to 7.00. He’s looking every bit of 42 years old for a team that needs reliable pitching production.
14. St. Louis Cardinals
Record: 5-3
Last Week: 15
After taking three of four from the Pirates and Royals to open the season, the Cardinals then split a four-game weekend series with the reigning NL Central-champion Brewers. Albert Pujols ripped his second home run of the year, and the 681st home run of his career, in Sunday’s loss at American Family Field. It left his bat at 109.9 mph and traveled 426 feet. He’s now just 19 big flies away from joining Barry Bonds, Hank Aaron, and Babe Ruth as the fourth member of the 700 home run club.
15. Seattle Mariners
Record: 5-5
Last Week: 13
They won two of three versus the division-rival Astros over the weekend, but the Mariners are .500 through 10 games. It’s not the most ideal start for an organization that is aiming to end a 20-year postseason drought, the longest such drought in North American sports. Julio Rodriguez is 4-for-32 (.125) with only one extra-base hit through his first nine major league games. And while Jarred Kelenic did homer last week against the White Sox, his batting line currently sits at .172/.242/.310.
16. Los Angeles Angels
Record: 6-5
Last Week: 16
Anaheim had won five of its last six games before falling 8-3 to the reigning AL West-champion Astros on Monday night in Houston. Mike Trout was missing from action in that one after taking a pitch off the top of his left hand on Sunday afternoon in Arlington. The good news is that X-rays and an MRI both came back negative for any structural damage. Word from Angels head athletic trainer Mike Frostad is that Trout will have to determine his own readiness for a return based on pain tolerance.
17. Minnesota Twins
Record: 4-6
Last Week: 17
Byron Buxton sadly -- predictably? -- tweaked something in his right knee while sliding into second base last Friday against the Red Sox. But the star outfielder has yet to be placed on the injured list, and Twins manager Rocco Baldelli expressed optimism on Monday that Buxton would be able to return to action sometime later this week. The same can’t be said for Alex Kirilloff, who landed on the IL last Wednesday due to a recurrence of wrist discomfort that dates all the way back to 2019.
18. Detroit Tigers
Record: 4-5
Last Week: 18
The growing expectations for the Tigers may have to be put on hold, as they were forced to place Javier Baez on the injured list over the weekend due to lingering soreness in his right thumb and will be without former No. 1 overall pick Casey Mize for an extended period after he was diagnosed with a medial collateral ligament sprain in his right elbow. There’s also some concern about Matt Manning, who left his start Sunday afternoon against the Royals because of shoulder discomfort.
19. Cleveland Guardians
Record: 4-5
Last Week: 19
Jose Ramirez was named American League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, claiming the honor for the fifth time in his illustrious 10-year major league career. The star third baseman agreed to a five-year, $124 million contract extension with Cleveland a just few days before Opening Day and has been red-hot out of the gate here in 2022, boasting a .457/.500/.886 batting line with eight extra-base hits (three homers, four doubles, one triple) and 15 RBI through nine games played.
20. Chicago Cubs
Record: 6-4
Last Week: 21
Seiya Suzuki was named National League Player of the Week on Monday afternoon, becoming only the eighth Japanese-born player to earn that honor. He then went 2-for-3 with two runs scored in the Cubs’ 4-2 defeat of the Rays on Monday night at Wrigley Field, growing his overall batting line to .429/.564/.929 through 39 plate appearances. He is the first Cubs player to hit safely in his first 10 major league games since Andy Pafko in 1943. We’ll say it: Suzuki is your 2021 NL Rookie of the Year.
21. Colorado Rockies
Record: 7-3
Last Week: 25
A relatively sparking 7-3 record through 10 games for the Rockies. They took two of three from the Dodgers to begin the season, swept a two-game set from the Rangers, split four with the Cubs over the weekend, and then shut down the Phillies for a 4-1 win on Monday night at Coors Field. C.J. Cron has a 1.129 OPS with five home runs and 10 RBI through 43 plate appearances. Connor Joe, who has seemingly taken over the leadoff role, is currently slashing .359/.468/.641.
22. Kansas City Royals
Record: 3-5
Last Week: 20
Major League Baseball is hard. Just ask Bobby Witt Jr., who was widely regarded as the No. 1 overall prospect in the sport after batting .290/.361/.576 with 33 homers and 29 steals over 124 games last summer in the minors. Witt tore up the Cactus League this spring and claimed a spot on the Opening Day roster in Kansas City, but he’s showing a weak .156/.182/.281 slash line through his first 33 plate appearances at the MLB level. He has struck out 11 times while drawing only one walk.
23. Miami Marlins
Record: 4-5
Last Week: 23
After winning only one of five games against the Giants and Angels to begin the 2022 campaign, the Marlins rallied to take three of four from the division-rival Phillies over the weekend. In a lopsided 11-3 victory on Sunday afternoon, Jazz Chisholm tallied an RBI triple in the bottom of the second, an RBI double in the bottom of the sixth, and a run-scoring sac fly in the bottom of the seventh. The dynamic 24-year-old has already driven home 10 runs in just seven games played.
24. Oakland Athletics
Record: 6-5
Last Week: 28
Unfortunately, the COVID-19 news cycle has yet to fully let up. Oakland got hit hard on Monday, having to place Austin Allen, Jed Lowrie, Chad Pinder, A.J. Puk, Kirby Snead, and Lou Trivino on the IL due to either positive tests, contact tracing, COVID-like symptoms, or some variety of the three. And yet the Athletics went out and earned a 5-1 win in their home opener against the Orioles and are a game above the .500 mark as the second full week of the 2022 season gets underway.
25. Arizona Diamondbacks
Record: 3-6
Last Week: 26
As a group right now, the Diamondbacks have a combined .152/.284/.264 slash line through 330 plate appearances. Seth Beer is the only Arizona hitter with a batting average above .212 and an OPS north of .704. Pull out Beer’s contributions and the collective line for the D-backs falls to .133/.272/.239 in 307 plate appearances. The rotation and its 3.03 ERA has been severely mistreated. They’re only moving up a spot in this week’s rankings because the Rangers so richly deserved to drop.
26. Texas Rangers
Record: 2-7
Last Week: 22
Not that the offense has been humming -- Marcus Semien is off to an especially discouraging start -- but it’s the pitching staff that is going to hold this team back from any semblance of contention after that big wintertime spending spree. As of Tuesday afternoon, Rangers starters and relievers have combined for a 6.19 ERA, by far the worst mark of any MLB team. Jon Gray (blister) is set to return from the injured list Tuesday at Seattle, but he’s doubtful to be the hero that Texas badly needs.
27. Washington Nationals
Record: 4-7
Last Week: 27
This is shaping up to be a very rough season for the Nationals, who just dropped three of four to the lowly Pirates. But, hey, they do still have Juan Soto. The 23-year-old slugger had a solo home run, a double, and two walks on Saturday in Pittsburgh and has now reached base at least four times in 54 different games over the course of his young career. The most games reaching base safely four-plus times before age 24 … Ted Williams: 76, Buddy Lewis: 55, Juan Soto: 54, Mel Ott: 53.
28. Cincinnati Reds
Record: 2-9
Last Week: 24
After getting dismantled by the Dodgers over the weekend in Los Angeles and falling 4-1 to the Padres on Monday night in San Diego, the Reds sit at the very bottom of the team OPS leaderboard with a mark of just .541. It doesn’t help that 2021 NL Rookie of the Year Award winner Jonathan India hasn’t played since last Thursday -- and apparently won’t be ready to return before this Friday -- because of a right hamstring issue. Hunter Greene is fun; Cincinnati’s offense currently is not.
29. Pittsburgh Pirates
Record: 5-5
Last Week: 29
Diego Castillo provided the only run of the night for the Pirates in their loss Monday against the Brewers, belting an opposite-field solo shot in the top of the fourth inning. The 24-year-old infielder also stroked a single in the top of the sixth and has raced out to a .310 batting average across his first 29 plate appearances as a big leaguer. Castillo has been handling second base for the Bucs with Ke’Bryan Hayes locked in long term at third. Now let’s bring on top shortstop prospect Oneil Cruz.
30. Baltimore Orioles

"‘Beyond troubling’: Current, former government officials tied to human trafficking probe in Georgia","Farmworker advocates linked to human trafficking and forced labor in Georgia

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas.

One individual indicted in the case, Brett Donovan Bussey, left government service in 2018. The other, Jorge Gomez, remains on the job and hasn’t been accused of wrongdoing, but officers searched his home in connection with the case and his sister and nephew are among those indicted.

In October, a grand jury indicted Bussey and 23 others for conspiring to engage in forced labor and other related crimes. Federal prosecutors say the defendants required guest farmworkers to pay illegal fees to obtain jobs, withheld their IDs so they could not leave, made them work for little or no pay, housed them in unsanitary conditions and threatened them with deportation and violence.

Two workers died in the heat, according to the indictment. Court records say five workers were kidnapped and one of them was raped.

All defendants who have entered pleas so far have pleaded not guilty in the case, named “Operation Blooming Onion.” Some of the workers harvested onions, the state’s official vegetable.

The indictment doesn’t mention the links to the Georgia government, information USA TODAY, the Savannah Morning News and the Augusta Chronicle pieced together from public records and a review of social media posts.

Labor advocates have questioned how the trafficking scheme described in the indictment could have continued so long – at least since 2015. The government connections raise additional questions about potential conflicts of interest and who is put in charge of protecting vulnerable workers.

“It’s beyond troubling,” said Shelly Anand, a former U.S. Department of Labor lawyer and co-founder of Sur Legal Collaborative, an Atlanta-area nonprofit that educates workers about their labor rights and helps them file labor complaints.

Story continues

In Georgia, the federal labor department has primary responsibility for enforcing migrant farmworker labor regulations. But the Georgia Department of Labor still can play a significant role in protecting farmworkers.

The state agency is supposed to report, resolve or refer suspicions of labor violations and help workers resolve or file complaints against their employers – farm labor contractors and farmers. The state also inspects housing that employers of foreign guest workers on seasonal H-2A visas must provide, a key hurdle to obtaining federal authorization to hire guest workers.

Bussey and Gomez both were directly involved in those tasks.

Brett Bussey, a former Georgia Department of Labor employee indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor.

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Patricio is the sister of a Georgia labor department official tasked with advocating for farmworkers.

Family members help bring in farmworkers

State Monitor Advocate Gomez is the brother of a central figure indicted in the case, Maria Leticia Patricio. In his state position, Gomez is in charge of advocating for migrant farmworkers and receives a copy of all complaints that migrant farmworkers file against employers to make sure they are handled correctly, including when they need to be referred to outside enforcement agencies.

As part of his job, he has also inspected migrant housing and provides technical assistance to state employees who do those inspections and handle workers’ complaints.

Federal records show several close family members, including Patricio, were hired by labor contractors and farmers to help them bring tens of thousands of guest workers to the U.S. by preparing petitions requesting government authorization to hire them.

In addition, officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. That filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez, who lives with him and also files guest worker petitions, but Gomez told a USA TODAY Network reporter that about $3,000 belonged to him.

The indictment doesn’t accuse Bussey, Patricio, or her son Daniel Mendoza of charging illegal fees, threatening workers with deportation and violence, or withholding their IDs. Indicted contractors and unnamed conspirators are accused of that. But Patricio is accused of aiding some of them and Mendoza is accused of aiding the kidnapping of four workers.

The home of Jorge Gomez in Douglas, Ga., has a locked gate with a sign alerting to security cameras on the property. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The filing says the money was seized from his daughter Graciela Gomez.

More than $7,500 was seized from the home of Maria Leticia Patricio in Nicholls, Ga.

Prosecutors also accuse Patricio and Mendoza of filing fraudulent petitions. Until 2017, Patricio was the registered agent of a company that Gomez’s daughter, Graciela Gomez, used to file petitions.

Gomez’s daughter was not indicted nor were at least two other family members, a sister and a niece, whose homes were searched or who had property confiscated in connection with the case.

The indictment says Patricio and other members of the alleged conspiracy profited more than $200 million with their scheme, but Patricio herself doesn’t seem to lead a wealthy lifestyle. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. The place is also the address of a radio station on which she hosted a broadcast of Mexican music.

The addresses linked to Patricio and several other family members are small mobile homes on the same dirt road near Douglas, a county seat of fewer than 12,000 residents in southern Georgia. In contrast, Gomez’s home is a 2,200-square-foot, single-family home on two acres, with a locked gate. A sign of “No trespassing” on a tree says security cameras are in use. Zillow puts its value at $195,100.

Douglas, Ga.

Downtown Douglas, Ga.

Gomez said he never did anything wrong and that he has never been reprimanded for not fulfilling his duties. He also said he plans to retire this summer.

“My family members’ business with employers has not affected my work for the state in any way,” he said in a written response. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.”

Patricio and Mendoza have pleaded not guilty.

Bussey, who was released from detention on a $50,000 bond, used to inspect housing for the Georgia Department of Labor as an agricultural specialist, a job he left in 2018. Federal prosecutors accuse him of witness tampering and filing fraudulent petitions requesting authorization to hire guest farmworkers on behalf of employers after leaving the government.

He also has pleaded not guilty and his lawyer said Bussey declined to comment.

The volume of H-2A guest worker petitions connected to each of the labor officials was significant.

Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data.

During the same timeframe, Bussey filed applications for nearly 3,800 approved workers in Georgia – 2% of the statewide total. Another application preparer, Inez Strickland – who has not been indicted but has links to Bussey and the case – filed applications for more than 12,500 approved positions, about 7%.

Prosecutors seized $10,500 at an address that Strickland used for her business on the petitions she filed. Her company is the registered agent for the business Bussey used to file petitions. Strickland also used to work for the state Department of Labor, at least in 2011, and for the Georgia Department of Education until 2016, including for the Migrant Education Program.

Nopalito Road in Nicholls, Ga., is a dirt road with at least four homes linked to Patricio and other family members.

Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients.

He said he did participate in outreach activities tied to those employers’ workers, listening but not acting. He also received copies of all forms describing potential violations and complaints, no matter which employer was involved.

Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.”

Maria Leticia Patricio, her indicted son Daniel Mendoza, and several relatives of Jorge Gomez who have prepared guest worker applications but aren’t indicted, declined to comment on the record or didn’t return phone calls, emails and letters.

Graciela Gomez said in an email that she works alone and doesn’t discuss her business with her father.

“Many of my clients/farmers don’t even know Jorge Gomez is my father,” she wrote. “I like to keep it that way. For this reason.”

She said she doesn’t know what happens after the workers arrive.

“I have nothing to do with what other people do with their business,” she wrote. “All I do is paperwork to get the (farm labor contractors) or (f)armers certified and approved for the H2A program. I don’t step foot on the farm at all.”

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

Jorge Gomez’s sister Laura Gomez-Morales – who also prepared guest worker petitions but is not named in Operation Blooming Onion – said in written responses that officers searched her home, too, but didn’t tell her why. She said her business was separate from that of Patricio and that she never asked Jorge Gomez to do any favors for her clients.

“The petitions I filed,” she said, “I never spoke to him about them, informed him, never asked him to do anything.”

The Georgia Department of Labor didn’t respond to questions about the procedures followed for Gomez to avoid potential conflicts of interest, or about specifics of Gomez and Bussey’s duties in the department. Agency spokeswoman Kersha Cartwright sent a statement saying the department declined to comment on the ongoing investigation into Operation Blooming Onion.

Egan Reich, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Labor, which audits the federally-funded monitor advocate program, said the agency can’t comment about active investigations or broader law enforcement matters.

Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided. Whetzel said the office hasn’t been informed of the status of the federal investigation but believes it is pending.

The Office of the Inspector General for the U.S. Department of Labor said the office could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation beyond what’s available on their site, per department policy.

Assistant U.S. Attorney E. Greg Gilluly Jr., one of the prosecutors in Operation Blooming Onion, also would not discuss the reporters’ findings. However, he did not discount the possibility of bringing charges against more people.

“We're continuing to investigate, and my goal is always to dismantle the organization,” said Gilluly. “So it's certainly possible that we would bring additional charges against other individuals in the future.”

A competitor accuses Gomez of strong-arming employers

The position of the state monitor advocate was created by federal regulations as a result of a lawsuit. The NAACP and other advocates had argued that farmworkers were systematically discriminated against by state employment agencies.

From the get-go, experts involved in that lawsuit questioned how employees hired by the states could handle complaints fairly and independently when they involved co-workers, bosses, or even farmers who could be part of their own social circle.

Anand, the former federal labor department lawyer, said Jorge Gomez handling complaints against employers while two of his family members are accused of helping corrupt farm labor contractors is the kind of thing that makes workers lose faith in the complaint system.

“When we have so many problems as we do in Georgia, we need someone who has no connections to individuals who could potentially be perpetrating violations,” she said.

The Georgia Department of Labor should have created a foolproof system to avoid conflicts of interest that do not depend on Jorge Gomez’s word, she said.

At least one person has raised questions about Gomez’s family’s relationship with guest worker employers. That was the husband of Inez Strickland, the petition preparer connected to Bussey and competitor of Gomez’s family members.

In 2018, Stephen Strickland sent a letter to Rep. Earl Leroy ""Buddy"" Carter, who represents a large portion of southeastern Georgia, saying he had received information that indicated Gomez was improperly using his position to solicit business for his daughter’s company – which the letter suggested actually was run by Jorge Gomez – including from Inez Strickland’s clients.

Reached by phone, one of the employers named by Strickland told a USA TODAY Network reporter that during a field visit Jorge Gomez made in his official capacity Gomez told the employer that Graciela Gomez prepared applications for guest workers, suggesting the employer could do business with her.

“He said that his daughter was doing paperwork, an application like those that Inez did,” said Remigio Morales, who has worked as a farm labor contractor.

Gomez said he remembers that Morales once told him that guest workers for whom he had applied to get visas hadn’t arrived. If asked, he added, he usually provided names of guest worker petition preparers but always made sure to not only mention his daughter. He said he stopped doing that and now just tells those who ask to look it up online.

Gomez denies the accusations in Strickland’s letter. Two other employers named by Strickland also denied his account of their interactions with Gomez. Graciela Gomez said that her father has nothing to do with her business, has never solicited work for her or referred any clients to her.

Elizabeth de Janes, counsel for the Georgia Department of Labor, said that the department started a human resources investigation but ultimately referred Strickland’s complaint to law enforcement due to an apparent lack of cooperation from the complainant. The complaint was also sent to the federal labor department, which did not respond to questions from USA TODAY Network reporters about whether the department opened an investigation.

Through her lawyer, Inez Strickland declined to comment about her connections to the Blooming Onion case and to Bussey.

A long record of labor violations

Farmworkers’ lawyers and advocates have long denounced labor abuses suffered by seasonal guest farmworkers, including by Georgia contractors or farmers. Some of those cases have links to Operation Blooming Onion.

In one litigated in civil court, guest farmworkers sued a Georgia contractor for labor trafficking saying that he charged them illegal fees, threatened them with deportation, failed to pay wages and abandoned them in unsanitary housing with no drinkable water and little food. Inez Strickland filed the paperwork for that contractor. She also reported the violations to Bussey when he worked for the Georgia Department of Labor.

A recent investigation by USA TODAY and the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel also exposed labor violations suffered by guest farmworkers employed by contractors.

It focused on a 24-year-old guest worker who died of heatstroke after picking tomatoes in Georgia. Gomez’s daughter, Graciela, filed the paperwork for the contractor who employed him and then, after the contractor was temporarily suspended from bringing more workers due to labor violations, she filed two other petitions on behalf of his wife’s newly created company.

The scale of those cases is eclipsed by Operation Blooming Onion. Last November, prosecutors announced the indictment that accuses Patricio – Gomez’s sister – Bussey and 22 others – mostly farm labor contractors or others associated with them – of conspiring to smuggle foreign nationals from Mexico, Guatemala and Honduras and to exploit workers.

.oembed-frame {width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;border:0;}

One of the defendants was dismissed after prosecutors learned he had been murdered – beheaded – in Mexico in 2019.

The indictment said workers were charged illegal fees for the opportunity to work in the U.S., a practice that can drive workers into debt and make them more reluctant to report abuse for fear that they will lose their U.S. jobs and, with them, the ability to repay debts.

Several workers were forced to dig onions with their bare hands and were threatened with a gun, according to the indictment.

Others, the indictment said, were required to work in restaurants and at golf clubs – which violates their visa regulations – or, if they paid extra, were allowed to leave without having to work in the fields.

The indictment also alleges defendants obtained fraudulent signatures and fake documents for purported U.S. employers to submit fraudulent guest worker petitions, and identifies six petitions allegedly sent by Patricio or Bussey in violation of mail fraud laws.

Recent federal criminal cases connected to Operation Blooming Onion offer some possible insights.

In one of them, a man named Yordon Velazquez (spelled “Yordan Velasquez” in some documents) admitted that he let another man, Aurelio Medina, use his name to request guest farmworkers because Medina was undocumented and not allowed to petition them, according to court records.

Medina was accused of illegally charging workers to obtain their visas and withholding their identification documents. He pleaded guilty to a federal charge of forced labor and was sentenced last month to 64 months in prison. Velazquez pleaded guilty to conspiracy and was sentenced to 13 months in prison.

One of the people indicted in the Operation Blooming Onion case, Patricio, filed the guest farmworker petitions on behalf of the company set up by Medina and Velazquez.

Gomez and Bussey cross paths

Jorge Gomez’s family had long worked in the fields. Gomez said his parents were farmworkers who became farm labor contractors. He ran a farm labor contracting business for two decades, according to written responses and personnel files. Gomez said he closed it when he started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2003.

Eight years later, Gomez became the state monitor advocate for migrant and seasonal farmworkers.

In that position, Gomez is supposed to conduct and supervise outreach to inform farmworkers about services and the system to file complaints, in addition to other tasks involving worker complaints and field checks to ensure employers weren’t violating the law. He also trains staff on how to conduct housing inspections.

Gomez said he would learn which employers were his relative’s clients when his family member’s email addresses showed up in email exchanges. In an interview, he said he recused himself from tasks such as inspecting housing, resolving complaints and conducting wage surveys or field checks concerning those employers. He also didn’t assist other labor department employees to inspect housing or handle complaints related to them, he said.

In 2017 or 2018, Gomez said, he stopped determining which labor employee would perform which housing inspections.

As an agricultural specialist, Bussey was among the labor department employees who could request assistance from Gomez for tasks such as handling complaints. In 2018, for example, he consulted with Gomez about what steps to take after receiving a report of possible farmworker labor law violations, according to a report he signed.

In addition to inspecting employee housing, Bussey’s responsibilities encompassed conducting farmworker outreach – including preparing reports about it that could be reviewed by Gomez – performing field checks, notifying employers, managers and/or enforcement agencies when violations occurred and conducting wage surveys, according to his performance reviews.

Bussey, who speaks Spanish, had started working for the Georgia Department of Labor in 2008. Previously he had worked for a couple of landscaping companies and a large nursery in Douglas, supervising Hispanic employees, according to his personnel file. The resume included in his application for a labor department job said his goal was to pursue a career in horticulture, landscaping, or as a golf course superintendent.

He remained in the labor department for a decade, until he resigned in 2018. He addressed his resignation letter to both his supervisor and “Jorge” – Jorge Gomez was the only Jorge working at the Georgia Department of Labor that year.

Gomez said he would review Bussey’s outreach monthly reports or provide technical assistance for complaints he received if Bussey requested it, but he said he didn’t supervise Bussey. He wasn’t sure why he would have been mentioned in the resignation letter.

Both Bussey and Gomez seemed to have struggled economically. Bussey received a default judgment for a credit card debt of nearly $8,000 in 2017 while Gomez’s lawyers said in a 2014 civil court filing that he and his wife were “of very limited modest means, just struggling to get by.”

Bussey went from making just over $24,000 working for the Georgia labor department in 2011 to $31,602 in 2018, plus about $9,600 in reimbursed travel expenses. Gomez’s salary was $35,660 in 2011 plus more than $12,400 in reimbursements, rising to a salary of $56,656 last year.

In his resignation letter, Bussey said: “I have decided to go into business for myself, where I will be earning considerably more money than I make with the GA Dept. of Labor.”

Gomez said in written responses to USA TODAY Network reporters that his wages when he started to work with the Georgia Department of Labor were very low and he suggested they had not improved much.

“After almost 20 years with the agency,” he said, “I still consider my wages modest and not enough to consider it a comfortable lifestyle.”

Two Georgia labor officials whose jobs involved protecting or advocating for farmworkers have links to one of the largest U.S. human trafficking cases ever prosecuted involving foreign agricultural laborers brought here on seasonal visas. Operation Blooming Onion: Federal indictment reveals 'modern-day-slavery' in Georgia

Maria Leticia Patricio, a defendant indicted in a criminal federal case, accused of conspiring to engage in forced labor involving foreign farmworkers. Officers seized $5,306 in cash at Gomez’s home, according to a court filing. The address she used to file the petitions is a rented mobile home located off a road next to the woods, according to Coffee County Assessor's information. During his nearly 20 years with the department, he added, “I do believe I have done a good job advocating and protecting farmworkers.” Employers relied on Jorge Gomez’s relatives to file petitions for more than 1 in 5 Georgia-based guest farmworker positions – over 40,000 positions in all – greenlit by the U.S. Department of Labor from 2015 through 2021, according to federal data. Gomez said he notified the Georgia Department of Labor that his sister, Patricio, and his daughter prepared petitions to request guest workers for employers and that to avoid conflicts of interest, he recused himself from tasks and decisions if they affected any of his family members’ clients. Dawson Morton, a labor lawyer who used to represent farmworkers in Georgia, said that part of the Georgia labor department’s job is to protect domestic workers and, if Gomez’s family members had a financial interest in importing foreign workers and paying them the lowest wages, that “creates a conflict of interest.” Bethany Whetzel, general counsel at the Office of the Georgia Inspector General told a USA TODAY Network reporter that, in 2018, the inspector general for the federal labor department requested information about Jorge Gomez, which was provided.

Ron Johnson pursues a scorched-earth path to reelection,"Ron Johnson’s approval ratings are underwater in a swing state that President Joe Biden won.

Instead of moving to the center, though, as he faces reelection this fall, the Wisconsin senator has become the face of conspiracy theories about Covid-19 and the 2020 election in the Senate. He has said that gargling mouthwash can kill the coronavirus, Jan. 6 was a mostly “peaceful protest,” and unvaccinated people around the world are being sent “basically into internment camps.”

For a vulnerable senator staring down a tough campaign, the string of head-turning remarks seem to defy political logic. But it turns out that Johnson’s shoot-from-the-lip style is a feature, not a bug, of his campaign for a third term. GOP strategists and officials say his unfiltered remarks are generating enthusiasm among a party base conditioned by Donald Trump, and appealing to independents who loathe Washington.

“He’s still perceived as an outsider. He’s not part of the GOP establishment in D.C., he never has been, and Wisconsinites like that,” said Bill McCoshen, a Wisconsin-based Republican strategist, who is not working on the race. “They may not agree with what he says every time, but they like the fact that he’s willing to speak his mind, and he’s not politically correct.”



Even Democrats largely aren’t campaigning this year against the controversial comments Johnson has made, instead focusing on the senator’s alleged self-dealing in Washington in an attempt to strip him of the non-politician veneer that helped him win past elections.

“Kellyanne Conway was right when she said voters vote on what affects them, not what offends them,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “But nobody likes being ripped off by someone who's out to serve themselves. And that's the core of our message.”

Despite Johnson’s hard turn to the right, this closely watched contest that could determine party control of the Senate is a coin flip, according to both Democratic and GOP consultants — a reflection of the fact that Republicans across the country face an extremely favorable political environment.

Story continues

Yet at the same time that he has served up red meat for the base, he’s also hedged his bets by presenting a softer side in TV ads in past elections. Johnson is replicating that playbook in this year’s midterm election.

He has run spots this campaign that highlight the Joseph Project, a program Johnson co-founded with the late African American Pastor Jerome Smith Sr., to help people in Milwaukee find jobs. One features Smith’s widow, Markeitha Smith, who attests, “I never would have thought that Ron Johnson would have ever been somebody who I can say is family. I remember thinking, ‘Wow, he actually came here.’”



In his successful bid in 2016, Johnson aired similar commercials on the initiative. His other positive spots this year are emotional testimonials from people who said his “Right to Try” legislation — which allows those with life-threatening diseases or conditions to try experimental drugs — saved their or their loved ones’ lives.

“It shows a more sensitive side to somebody who’s been working out in Washington, D.C. for the last 12 years,” said Brandon Scholz, former executive director of the Wisconsin Republican Party. “Instead, somebody’s on the local news talking about helping people and jobs in a place you wouldn’t expect to see Ron Johnson, in center city Milwaukee.”

A Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who worked on the 2016 Senate race, in which Johnson defeated former Democratic Sen. Russ Feingold, said Johnson has won in the past because he excited GOP diehards on right-wing radio while also appealing to white suburban women with his TV ads.

“Ron Johnson has been consistently underestimated as a candidate,” the person said, requesting anonymity to speak frankly. “He has figured out how to be different people to different audiences.”

In regards to his comments about Covid-19, Johnson has said previously that he did not mean that mouthwash should be an alternative to the vaccine, and his office pointed to an Australian quarantine site when asked about his internment camp remarks. Speaking about the Capitol riot, while he downplayed the events of Jan. 6, he condemned the violence that day.

The case that Johnson can win reelection this year rests in part on a standout number — he outperformed Trump in 2016 by 74,000 votes, including in Milwaukee and Dane counties, where Madison is located, as well as in suburban Waukesha, Ozaukee and Washington, or “WOW,” counties, reliably GOP areas where Trump experienced some slippage in 2020.

Republicans are also counting on Johnson to benefit from voters turning against Democrats nationally. In Wisconsin, 52 percent of voters disapprove of Biden's performance, while 43 percent approve, according to a Marquette Law School poll in February.

GOP strategists said Johnson has shown the ability to unify the MAGA base and more old-school Republicans in the suburbs, while also picking up anti-establishment independents. In Wisconsin, they said, many swing voters are not traditional moderates, but instead are more defined by their loathing of Washington and the state capitol.

In commercials in his previous campaigns, Johnson leaned into being the only manufacturer in a sea of lawyers in the Senate.

“Ron Johnson is truly his own man. He could say anything tomorrow, and you could call me and I’d say, ‘I had no idea he was going to say that,’” said a person close to Johnson. “That’s full of risk and that’s full of hand-wringing by the establishment Republicans and it’s full of alarm-ringing by the media. And it’s also full of authenticity with voters, including swing voters, not just the base.”



At the same time that Trump lost his second bid in Wisconsin, Republican congressional candidates in total also outperformed the then-president by more than 50,000 votes — evidence of the willingness of some conservative and swing voters to cast their ballots for those in the GOP not named Trump.

Still, Democrats view the race as a top opportunity to pick up a Republican-held seat. After nearly a dozen years in the Senate, they think they can pierce Johnson’s image as an outsider businessman. In fact, they think it’s already been popped: Johnson is viewed unfavorably by 45 percent of voters, compared to 33 percent who see him favorably, according to the recent Marquette poll. Twenty-one percent said they hadn’t heard enough about Johnson or didn’t know.

“I think it is entirely possible that Democrats have a bad night nationally, and Ron Johnson still loses,” said Joe Zepecki, a Wisconsin-based Democratic strategist who is not working for any Senate candidate. “That's how much trouble I really genuinely believe that he's in here.”

Democrats have seized on a plan to paint Johnson as self-serving for pushing for a provision in Trump’s tax bill that benefited his own company and campaign donors. In 2017, Johnson held his vote for the legislation until he secured a bigger tax cut for “pass-through” entities, arguing that small businesses would be undercut at the expense of corporations otherwise.

Opportunity Wisconsin, an anti-Johnson group, has aired more than $3 million of negative ads hitting him for “passing tax laws that benefit himself.” And Democrats think he recently put his foot in his mouth in a way that makes their case for them. At a meeting with GOP activists this month, Johnson was asked how to fight back against attacks about the tax bill.

“Now, did my business benefit? Sure,” Johnson said. “Did some of my donor businesses? Sure. When you give tax relief to everybody, everybody benefits.”

Jake Wilkins, a spokesperson for Johnson, defended his advocacy for the tax legislation as “single-handedly keeping small businesses competitive with the big guys by insisting on tax cuts for everyone.”

Wilkins also touted the senator’s work on the Joseph Project and Right to Try: “Based on what he has accomplished, Senator Johnson believes he is in a strong position to win reelection. His strategy will be to do what he has consistently done: work hard and simply tell the truth.”

Charlie Sykes, a Wisconsin native and anti-Trump ex-Republican, previously supported Johnson but now compares him to Joseph McCarthy, the former Wisconsin senator who led a demagogic red-baiting campaign.

“Johnson should be the most vulnerable Republican in the country,” he said. But given the political mood, the race “leans Republican, even as unpopular as Johnson is, unless the Democrats can really get their act together.”",Holly Otterbein,https://news.yahoo.com/ron-johnson-pursues-scorched-earth-083000728.html,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,Yahoo,"Ron Johnson’s approval ratings are underwater in a swing state that President Joe Biden won. “Kellyanne Conway was right when she said voters vote on what affects them, not what offends them,” said Ben Wikler, chair of the Wisconsin Democratic Party. “ But nobody likes being ripped off by someone who's out to serve themselves.

"April nor'easter drops more than a foot of snow, knocks power out for thousands","A spring nor'easter has already dropped at least a foot of snow on parts of New York and Pennsylvania, leading to power outages and the closure of businesses and schools.

More than 240,000 customers were without power in the Northeast Tuesday morning. New York had the most outages at more than 160,000, while Pennsylvania had more than 50,000, according to PowerOutage.us.

Virgil, in upstate New York, had seen the most snowfall by Tuesday afternoon, with 18 inches on the ground.

Indian Lake, New York, and New Milford, Pennsylvania, were each buried in 16 inches of snow.

Broome County, New York, implemented a travel ban. Binghamton, which is within Broome, got 14.2 inches of snow, setting the record for their biggest April snowstorm.

The heavy, wet snow was falling at a rate of 1 to 2 inches per hour across upstate New York.

In Syracuse, the rapid snowfall and outages prompted numerous school and business closures.

Forecasters said the snow is expected to taper through the day, but not before dropping 3 to 6 more inches. The highest totals will be in the Adirondack Mountains.

High winds will stay in place through the night, long after the snow stops.

Nantucket, Massachusetts, will likely see wind gusts of 43 mph, while Islip, on New York's Long Island, will see 39 mph gusts.

An ""abnormally chilly air-mass"" in the east will remain through the middle of the week, according to the National Weather Service.

""A handful of daily record cold high and low temperatures are forecast in parts of the Midwest, Great Lakes, and Northeast today,"" the weather service said.

About 40 million people were under frost and freeze alerts Tuesday morning stretching from the central Plains to the mid-Atlantic.

"Trump Allies Continue Legal Drive to Erase His Loss, Stoking Election Doubts","A group of President Donald Trump’s allies and associates spent months trying to overturn the 2020 election based on his lie that he was the true winner.

Now, some of the same confidants who tried and failed to invalidate the results based on a set of bogus legal theories are pushing an even wilder sequel: that by “decertifying” the 2020 vote in key states, the outcome can still be reversed.

In statehouses and courtrooms across the country, as well as on right-wing news outlets, allies of Trump — including lawyer John Eastman — are pressing for states to pass resolutions rescinding Electoral College votes for President Joe Biden and to bring lawsuits that seek to prove baseless claims of large-scale voter fraud. Some of those allies are casting their work as a precursor to reinstating the former president.

Sign up for The Morning newsletter from the New York Times

The efforts have failed to change any statewide outcomes or uncover mass election fraud. Legal experts dismiss them as preposterous, noting that there is no plausible scenario under the Constitution for returning Trump to office.

But just as Eastman’s original plan to use Congress’ final count of electoral votes on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the election was seen as far-fetched in the run-up to the deadly Capitol riot, the continued efforts are fueling a false narrative that has resonated with Trump’s supporters and stoked their grievances. They are keeping alive the same combustible stew of conspiracy theory and misinformation that threatens to undermine faith in democracy by nurturing the lie that the election was corrupt.

The efforts have fed a cottage industry of podcasts and television appearances centered around not only false claims of widespread election fraud in 2020, but the notion that the results can still be altered after the fact — and Trump returned to power, an idea that he continues to push privately as he looks toward a probable reelection run in 2024.

Story continues

Democrats and some Republicans have raised deep concerns about the impact of the decertification efforts. They warn of unintended consequences, including the potential to incite violence of the sort that erupted on Jan. 6, when a mob of Trump’s supporters — convinced that he could still be declared the winner of the 2020 election — stormed the Capitol. Legal experts worry that the focus on decertifying the last election could pave the way for more aggressive — and earlier — legislative intervention the next time around.

“At the moment, there is no other way to say it: This is the clearest and most present danger to our democracy,” said J. Michael Luttig, a leading conservative lawyer and former appeals court judge, for whom Eastman clerked and whom President George W. Bush considered as a nominee to be the chief justice of the United States. “Trump and his supporters in Congress and in the states are preparing now to lay the groundwork to overturn the election in 2024 were Trump, or his designee, to lose the vote for the presidency.”

Most of Trump’s aides would like him to stop talking about 2020 — or, if he must, to focus on changes to voting laws across the country rather than his own fate. But like he did in 2020 when many officials declined to help him upend the election results, Trump has found a group of outside allies willing to take up an outlandish argument they know he wants to see made.

The efforts have been led or loudly championed by Mike Lindell, the CEO of MyPillow; Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser; Steve Bannon, the former White House chief strategist; and Boris Epshteyn, an aide and associate of Trump’s.

Another key player has been Eastman, the right-wing lawyer who persuaded Trump shortly after the election that Vice President Mike Pence could reject certified electoral votes for Biden when he presided over the congressional count and declare Trump the victor instead.

Eastman wrote a memo and Epshteyn sent an email late last year to the main legislator pushing a decertification bill in Wisconsin, laying out a legal theory to justify the action. Eastman met last month with Robin Vos, the speaker of the state Assembly, and activists working across the country, a meeting that was reported earlier by The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.

Jefferson Davis, an activist from Wisconsin, said he had asked Eastman to join the meeting after hearing about his work on behalf of Trump following the election.

“If it was good enough for the president of the United States,” Davis said in an interview, “then his expertise was good enough to meet with Speaker Vos in Wisconsin on election fraud and what do we do to fix it.”

Vos has maintained that the Legislature has no pathway to decertification, in line with the guidance of its own lawyers.

“There is no mechanism in state or federal law for the Legislature to reverse certified votes cast by the Electoral College and counted by Congress,” the lawyers wrote, adding that impeachment was the only way to remove a sitting president other than in the case of incapacity.

But Eastman has made clear that he has no intention of dropping his fight to prove that the election was stolen. The House committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack has said his legal efforts to invalidate the results most likely violated the law by trying to defraud the American people. A federal judge recently agreed, calling Eastman’s actions “a coup in search of a legal theory.”

Legal experts say his continued efforts could increase his criminal exposure; but if Eastman were ever to be charged with fraud, he could also point to his recent work as evidence that he truly believed the election was stolen.

“There are a lot of things still percolating,” Eastman said in an interview with The New York Times last fall. He claimed that states had illegally given people the ability to cast votes in ways that should have been forbidden, corrupting the results. And he pointed to a widely debunked video from State Farm Arena in Atlanta, which he claimed showed that tabulation ballots were run through counting machines multiple times during the election.

Charles Burnham, Eastman’s lawyer, said in a statement that he “was recently invited to lend his expertise to legislators and citizens in Wisconsin confronting significant evidence of election fraud and illegality. He did so in his role as a constitutional scholar and not on behalf of any client.”

The fringe legal theory that Eastman and Epshteyn are promoting — which has been widely dismissed — holds that state lawmakers have the power to choose how electors are selected, and they can change them long after the Electoral College has certified votes if they find fraud and illegality sufficiently altered the outcome. The theory has surfaced in multiple states, including several that are political battlegrounds.

As in Wisconsin, state legislators in Arizona drafted resolutions calling for the decertification of the 2020 election. In Georgia, a lawsuit sought to decertify the victories of the Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. And Robert Regan, a Republican favored to win a seat in the Michigan House, has said he wants to decertify the 2020 election either through a ballot petition or the courts.

Bannon, Lindell and Epshteyn have repeatedly promoted decertification at the state level on Bannon’s podcast, “War Room,” since last summer, pushing it as a steady drumbeat and at times claiming that it could lead to Trump being put back into office. They have described the so-called audit movement that began in Arizona and spread to other states as part of a larger effort to decertify electoral votes.

“We are on a full, full freight train to decertify,” Epshteyn said on the program in January. “That’s what we’re going to get. Everyone knows. Everyone knows this election was stolen.”

Last fall, 186 state legislators from 39 states joined a letter written by Wendy Rogers, a Republican state senator from Arizona who has appeared at events hosted by Lindell, calling on “each state to decertify its electors where it has been shown the elections were certified prematurely and inaccurately.”

All the efforts have either failed to progress or been rejected for lack of legal grounds in the absence of any evidence of widespread voter fraud that could have affected the 2020 election. And even as elected Republicans have almost uniformly embraced Trump’s claims that the vote was stolen, many have rejected the idea that states should decertify their results or argued that the effort was merely symbolic, noting that he could never be reinstated.

Still, Trump is now the front-runner in public opinion surveys of the possible Republican presidential field. While he has yet to declare his candidacy, he has privately told associates that he is planning to run again.

A spokesperson for Trump did not respond to an email seeking comment.

The legal drive to reverse his 2020 loss has had ripple effects in the Republican Party. With midterm congressional elections less than six months away, the push has put pressure on candidates to either endorse it or risk the wrath of Trump and his supporters. In Alabama, Rep. Mo Brooks said that the former president had repeatedly demanded that he “rescind” the election and remove Biden. When the congressman said that was impossible, Trump withdrew his endorsement in the state’s Senate Republican primary.

In Pennsylvania, Jake Corman, the top Republican in the state Senate who promised last year to review the 2020 election results, said he had dropped plans to end his bid for governor after Trump urged him to “keep fighting.” He then went on Bannon’s podcast, where Corman said there was “no question” about the need to investigate whether electors needed to be decertified in battleground states, and pledged to “turn the Department of State upside down” to find evidence of illegality.

Last year, Lindell vocally championed the false claim that Biden’s victory could somehow be overturned. In Lindell’s telling, Trump would have been back in office by last August. The former president began telling associates the same thing, privately urging supporters to echo it and pressing conservative writers to state it.

August came and went with no return by Trump, but that did little to quash the idea. Flynn, who recently met with Trump at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, according to people close to the former president, posted messages on the social media platform Telegram calling for decertification of the results in Wisconsin.

But even among Trump’s staunchest backers, there is a divide over the decertification efforts, with some calling them a waste of energy.

Mike Roman, a former Trump campaign official, pointed out at a recent event with conservative activists in Pennsylvania that the idea of Trump being reinstated as president was not realistic.

“We’re not going to overturn the election in 2020,” Roman told the attendees. “We’re just not.”

"Divers recover the bobbing Bronco of Bar Harbor, Maine","Avert your eyes, Blue Oval fans. There's one fewer Ford Bronco on the road today than there was last week. And that's because the Bronco we're focusing on today is in the water, not on land. The photos you see here were taken by Kip Wing of Aerial Aesthetic in Maine, near Bar Harbor. The driver of a Bronco was reportedly attempting to drive in the sand at low tide between the coast and Bar Island when they got stuck and couldn't get out ahead of the rising tide.

The result? One sunken Ford Bronco. Fortunately, reports indicate the Bronco's occupant(s) got out safely.

According to a few sources cited by The Drive, locals say the driver of the Bronco was doing donuts in the sand, which goes a long way toward explaining how they got stuck in the first place. As you can see in the video above, a pair of pickup trucks tried to free the SUV from its sandy grave using tow straps, but gave that up when one of them snapped.

The Bronco has since been floated using buoyancy bags that a diver attached to the vehicle from underneath. Island Towing then attached ropes and pulled the Bronco into an area that was accessed with a wrecker, and the Bronco was back to dry land.",Jeremy Korzeniewski,https://www.autoblog.com/2022/04/18/ford-bronco-sunk-bar-harbor-maine/,https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1062x597/format/jpg/quality/100/https://s.aolcdn.com/os/ab/_cms/2022/04/18141736/ford-bronco-sunk-bar-harbor.jpeg,Yahoo,"There's one fewer Ford Bronco on the road today than there was last week.

This Ford Bronco Has Been Stuck on a Sandbar for Days,"Photo credit: Everydaydrones via YouTube

The Ford Bronco is one of the most capable and desirable off-roaders on sale today. As such, we’ve all gotten to watch videos of these SUVs pulling off some incredible feats on the trails. That said, one Bronco driver out in Bar Harbor, Maine, learned the limits of their new 4x4 the hard way when it became lodged on a sandbar over the weekend. Unfortunately for them, that ill-advised parking spot has turned into a truck drowning site in several feet of deep Atlantic water.

🚘 Don’t miss any amazing stories. Join our team.

According to WDEA, the Bronco became stuck on the sandbar this past Saturday afternoon. The driver was reportedly doing donuts with the 4x4 before becoming unable to get free. While simply getting stuck on a beach might not always be the worst-case scenario, this particular owner seems to have missed the nearby warning signs that point out the dangerously high tides in the area. Perhaps that lack of local knowledge can be explained by the truck’s New Jersey plates. Either way, things became very expensive shortly thereafter.



Regardless of how it was placed there, the Bronco could not be extricated before the deeper water returned from the sea. The incoming tides drowned the 4x4 up to the base of its windshield, which must have been an awful sight for the owner. The Bronco might be able to survive fording through 33.5-inches of water, but there isn’t a chance it will survive this ordeal. Attempts were once again made to rescue the SUV on Easter morning, though you can watch how that ended in the video.

It can be hard not to feel invincible when you’re behind the wheel of something like the Bronco. With the capability on offer from a modern 4x4, it isn’t hard for an inexperienced owner to get a bit overconfident. Hopefully the owner of this particular Bronco doesn’t have to wait terribly long for a replacement.

The sinking of Russia's flagship might be a bad sign for the U.S. Navy,"A ship. Illustrated | iStock

It's tempting for Americans to get smug about the sinking of the Moskva, the Russian Navy's flagship in the Black Sea. Whether it was destroyed by Ukrainians or — less plausibly — sunk because of a non-combat onboard explosion of ammunition, the result is both a humiliation and a setback for Vladimir Putin's war efforts. If you're cheering Ukraine's defenders, it's hard not to take some satisfaction in that.

But America's fleet might also be more vulnerable than you think.

For several years now, going back to a pair of collisions separately involving the U.S.S. John S. McCain and U.S.S. Fitzgerald in 2017, there have been a series of reports indicating that the U.S. Navy is overstretched, overworked, and under-maintained, and thus increasingly vulnerable as it goes about the expensive task of patrolling the world's oceans.

A February report by the Government Accountability Office broke down the ugly details of how Navy personnel are struggling to keep their ships running properly. ""Some crewmembers provided examples of parts such as electrical safety equipment being on backorder for up to 2 years and described difficulties locating consumable materials such as filters, specific types of oil, and protective clothing for themselves,"" the GAO reported. ""Ten of the 16 ships' crews we met with stated that they resorted to cannibalizing parts — that is, taking functional parts away from other ships, in turn leaving them less-than-operational — so their respective ships could remain operational.""

America might have what is regarded as the most powerful navy in the world — China has the largest, but many of its ships are smaller — but it is clearly fragile. And that's a problem.

""The U.S. Navy is on the verge of strategic bankruptcy,"" Christopher Dougherty, a former assistant defense secretary, wrote last year. ""Its fleet isn't large enough to meet global day-to-day demands for naval forces. Due to repeated deployments and maintenance backlogs, the fleet also isn't ready enough to meet these demands safely, nor can it quickly surge in an emergency."" He concluded that ""the risk of its debts coming due suddenly (and perhaps violently) will increase.""

Story continues

Even without those challenges, there is also the question of whether the U.S. Navy is built for the modern world.

Just as aircraft carriers once replaced battleships as the backbone of the fleet, there are now questions about whether America's carrier-based fleet is overly vulnerable to a new generation of Chinese anti-ship ballistic missiles. And those questions are likely to get more pertinent if it turns out the Ukrainians really did take out the Moskva with their new Neptune missile.

America has spent much of the 21st century learning that the overwhelming power of its armed forces isn't always so overwhelming. The sinking of the Moskva is a sign that such a lesson might also extend to the U.S. Navy. Finding out the hard way might be disastrous.

The Chances of Finding Alien Life on Jupiter’s Moon Europa Just Shot Way Up,"NASA

Forget Mars—Jupiter’s moon Europa is one of the most promising worlds in the solar system to look for alien life, in large part because it boasts a huge liquid ocean sitting below a sheet of ice. Although Europa is just one-fourth the diameter of Earth, its ocean may have twice as much water as our planet’s oceans combined. And where there is water, there is the chance for life as we know it to settle down.

But actually discovering whatever alien life might live on Europa will be an extremely tough challenge. The moon’s icy shell is thought to be 10 to 15 miles thick. The furthest humans have ever dug into Earth is 7.67 miles.

However, it might not be as daunting as we think. A new study published in Nature Communications on Tuesday reveals that the icy shell itself might be much more porous than previously thought. In fact, the ice might be home to multiple pockets of water that could support life as well.

Why NASA is Obsessed With Europa, Jupiter’s Watery Moon

The key to these new findings? Greenland. New data collected with ice-penetrating radar shows the formation of “double ridge” features in the Greenland ice sheet—features that are present on Europa as well. The researchers behind the new paper believe that the mechanism for how these double ridges formed in Greenland ought to apply to Europa—which suggests that there is more liquid water on the Jovian moon than we could ever have imagined.

“It was really a bit of serendipity,” Riley Culberg, an electrical engineer pursuing a PhD at Stanford University who led the new study, told The Daily Beast. “One of my colleagues on this paper, who is a planetary scientist, was giving a presentation on the big open questions in Europa science and showed a picture of these double ridges on the surface. It struck me that I had seen a similar looking feature in my own data from Earth while working on a totally different project related to climate change impacts on the Greenland ice sheet.”

Story continues

Culberg and his colleagues went back to the Europa data, and found that double ridges on the Jovian moon (first observed in the 1990s by NASA’s Galileo mission) exhibit a peculiar kind of ratio between the height of the ridges and the distance between the two peaks. After accounting for the difference in gravity between Earth and Europa, the team realized the Greenland features had a pretty similar ratio as well, which meant the double ridges seemed to form similarly in both places.

Artist’s conception shows how double ridges on the surface of Jupiter’s moon Europa may form over shallow, refreezing water pockets within the ice shell. Justice Blaine Wainwright

We know that the double ridges form in Greenland when ice fractures around pockets of pressurized liquid water that was refreezing inside the ice sheet, prompting two peaks to rise in a specific shape. These pockets of water are shallow and help make the ice sheet more porous.

The researchers believe the same mechanism accounts for the double ridges on Europa—meaning the icy shell is dynamic, permeable, and perhaps rife with shallow bodies of liquid water.

“If Europa’s double ridges also form in this way, it suggests that shallow water pockets must have been, or maybe still are, extremely common in the ice shell,” said Culberg. “Double ridges are by far the most common surface that we see in imagery from Europa, so if they form over water, it would really have to be everywhere in the ice shell.” That means the opportunities for life to evolve on the Jovian moon are much more common.

Culberg cautioned that we won’t be able to confirm any of this until we’ve had a chance to actually study Europa directly. That will likely occur in the next decade: NASA is planning to launch an orbiting probe called Europa Clipper in October 2024, and it should arrive on Europa in April 2030. It will be armed with an ice-penetrating radar that will be critical at telling us more about Europa’s icy shell—and should help uncover whether Europa really is our solar system’s best bet for supporting life.

2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E order books closed for good,"Even after being hit with price increases from $1,000 to $2,000 last December, the 2022 Ford Mustang Mach-E continued to be too hot a commodity. By the beginning of March, Ford closed order books for three of the five trims: Premium, California Route 1, and GT Performance. That left the Select and GT on the menu until recently, when Ford took those trims off the shelf and closed up the Mustang Mach-E shop. The model page on Ford's website informs all, ""Due to high demand, the current model year is no longer available for retail order. Limited inventory may be available at selected dealers. Contact your dealer for more information.""

Note, this is only a matter for the U.S. at the moment. Ford's Canadian website still shows four Mach-E trims on offer, omitting only the GT.

CarsDirect reports that the Ford sent a letter to dealers saying the price increases meant to take effect on April 13 have been canceled. That seems obvious when dealing with a product no longer available to order, but the instructions could be for vehicle allocations that end up on dealer lots. Not that a manufacturer price increase would matter, considering the raging markups customers are willing to pay.

Or perhaps postponed is a better word than canceled for the increases. The price bumps were rumored to run from $2,000 to $5,000, with the delivery charge climbing another $100. We figure they'll show up when Ford announces the 2023 Mach-E.

Waiting for order books to open for next year's model, or scouting among the potential ""limited inventories"" on dealer lots will be the only way get a Mach E in the meantime. On paper, the situation next year should improve thanks to Ford's pledge to double battery production and triple Mach-E production. But nothing has returned to any kind of normal in the world, the F-150 Lightning is expected to enter production next week, and even after semiconductors and the supply chain stop misbehaving, the pent-up market demand needs to exhaust itself before we can see what the world might look like on the other side of this chaotic hump.

"If a marriage doesn’t last, why should alimony? DeSantis can fix this injustice | Opinion","Thirty years ago, at 14, I was a child who made a huge mistake. I married my first boyfriend because I was pregnant with his child. I found myself trapped in an abusive relationship with a man who abused pain medication every day, refused to work and only wanted to live off government assistance. I didn’t believe in any of that and vowed to work myself out of that life.

Against all odds, I went to college, got my degree and became a public-school teacher in Florida. I loved working with children in school and spending time with my own children. During this time, my husband became more abusive. Ten years ago, I got the courage to leave the marriage with the hope of building a happy life for myself and my children.

However, during the divorce, I learned a word I had never known — alimony. It never occurred to me that if I left this horrible situation, I would have to continue to work to pay a significant amount of my hard-earned income to a man who refused to work, abused his family and still refuses to even look for work. How could this happen?

Actually, Florida law allows it to happen, and divorce lawyers drain families of all their savings and assets to get as much alimony as possible for their clients, in this case my ex-husband. The inconsistency of outcomes in court encourages costly, lengthy litigation. And, who really wins? Divorce lawyers.

I was forced to pay permanent lifetime alimony to a man who never cared for his children, who lives far away and who has never even tried to sustain himself. I have been paying him for the past 10 years, while I continue to work and better myself. How can the courts say that I have to do this forever, until I die. How is this fair?

I implore Gov. Ron DeSantis to sign the alimony reform legislation — Senate Bill 1796 — into law. The bill proposes reasonable guidelines and makes it harder for divorce lawyers to use children as bargaining chips during divorce proceedings when mothers and fathers are already going through a challenging time.

Story continues

The bill also creates parameters for the already existing “right to retire” for alimony payers like me, which are rarely enforced by the courts. Even trying to modify modifiable alimony agreements is cost-prohibitive thanks to antiquated laws and divorce attorneys’ fees. The governor can help Florida’s families by signing SB 1796 into law, bringing equity, predictability and an opportunity for alimony payers like me to retire with dignity.

Woman probing cactus in Arizona yard pulls out two diamondback rattlesnakes at once,"Rattlesnake catchers don’t like surprises, but that’s what happened to Marissa Maki when she started poking around a cactus.

Venomous snakes had been seen in an Arizona family’s yard, and video shows Maki found them in a most unexpected way.

She stuck a pair of tongs deep into a pink cactus and pulled the tool out seconds later with two very excited snakes writhing from the grip.

They were western diamondback rattlesnakes, each one nearly 3 feet long. Maki was surprised, but she kept her head, the video shows.

“I thought I had just one and then I somehow got both the snakes. It was pretty awesome,” Maki told McClatchy News. “I’ve never done that before and I was excited. I wish I could say I planned that, but it was pure accident.”

Video of her “double grab” has been viewed more than 7,200 times since being posted by Maki’s employer, Rattlesnake Solutions, an Arizona-based snake relocation service. Some have called it more “crazy” than cool, given Maki was dodging two sets of fangs at once.

It happened March 23 in the Gold Canyon area southeast of Phoenix. The homeowners had reported seeing rattlesnakes in the front yard, calling Rattlesnake Solutions out of fear the reptiles would eventually encounter their recently acquired puppy.

Western diamondback rattlesnakes live to 20 years and average 3 to 5 feet in Arizona, though some have been known to reach 7 feet, according to the Arizona-Sonora Desert Museum.

The two snakes Maki caught were happily coiled up at the base of the cactus and clearly annoyed (lots of rattlings) when Maki interrupted their quality time.

They were placed in a bucket together and eventually relocated to a large pack rat nest in the desert, which is standard procedure for Rattlesnake Solutions. The company captured and relocated 1,500 snakes last year and expects to do “slightly more” this year.

"Despite Putin's claims that the West's 'economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work,' Moscow's mayor says the city is about to lose 200,000 jobs","Mayor Sergei Sobyanin detailed an employment plan worth $41 million in an effort to mitigate the dearth in jobs. Mikhail Svetlov/Getty Images

Moscow's mayor says 200,000 Russians in the city are likely to soon be without work.

Hundreds of Western companies have distanced themselves from Russia, creating a dearth in jobs.

Some global firms pledged to continue paying their local workers, though it's unclear for how long.

Moscow's mayor said on Monday that hundreds of thousands of city residents could lose their jobs as Western companies suspended or pulled their operations from Russia.

""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Mayor Sergei Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post.

In the post, Sobyanin said Moscow had approved an employment-support program worth 3.36 billion rubles, or roughly $41 million, that would supply temporary jobs or training to those without work.

Sobyanin wrote that about 58,000 employees were expected to benefit from the program and that Russia would provide a monthly allowance for children and loans for small and medium-size businesses.

Sobyanin's comments came as Russian President Vladimir Putin continued to deny Western sanctions had affected Russia's economy.

""We can now confidently say that such policy (of sanctions) towards Russia has failed,"" he said on Monday. ""The economic blitzkrieg strategy didn't work. Moreover, the initiators themselves couldn't get away with the sanctions.""

More than 750 companies have publicly announced that they will cut operations in Russia to some degree since the invasion of Ukraine began, according to the Yale School of Management.

Some companies have pledged to continue paying their Russian workers while they're closed in the country, though it's unclear how long they plan to sustain their support.

McDonald's, one of the first major businesses to withdraw from Russia, said its store closures in the country cost the company $50 million a month because it kept its about 62,000 local workers on the payroll. Some of its locations are still open because the franchisees who own and operate those restaurants have refused to close, the Russian state news agency RIA Novosti reported.

Sobyanin's post indicated that Moscow was still grappling with a long list of crises. City authorities will discuss in the next two weeks how the capital will maintain its stock of medicines without imports and how it will keep its hospitality industry afloat, he wrote.

""There is a lot of work to be done, the results of which will appear only in a few years,"" Sobyanin wrote.

Despite Putin's confidence, Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin sounded the alarm for the Russian capital on Tuesday.

""According to our estimates, about 200,000 people are at risk of losing their jobs,"" Sobyanin wrote in an official blog post, according to a translation from Business Insider.

President Joe Biden and other NATO leaders have pointed to evidence of weakness in the Russian economy since the sanctions began. Russia's Ruble had lost almost half of its value by the second week of March, less than a month after Russia's invasion.

Nevertheless, some Western experts say the sanction campaign is not having the desired effect on Russia's economy despite its economy's weakened state.

"Russia will retaliate if its Warsaw embassy cannot work, Russian envoy says","By Joanna Plucinska

WARSAW (Reuters) - Russia will retaliate against Poland if its embassy in Warsaw stops working because it cannot receive fresh funds from Moscow, its ambassador warned on Tuesday.

In March, Poland expelled 45 Russian diplomats over allegations of working for Russian intelligence and blocked the embassy's bank accounts. Moscow, which dismissed the accusations as baseless, retaliated in kind.

""We have some cash reserves, but they are not unlimited and unless the situation changes, after some time it may so happen that we shall not be in a position to pay our bills,"" Sergiy Andreev, 63, told Reuters.

""And it should be clear that as soon as our embassy stops functioning here, the same will happen to the Polish embassy in Moscow,"" he added.

Relations between Russia and Central European countries that once formed part of its sphere of influence have long been fraught but the invasion of Ukraine has fueled fear and suspicion about Moscow's intentions.

Andreev did not specify how soon the embassy may run out of cash, but added that about three-quarters of Russian officials who held diplomatic passports were expelled from Poland.

A spokesperson for Poland's foreign affairs ministry said 45 Polish diplomats were asked to leave Moscow in retaliation and the Polish embassy's bank accounts were frozen.

Andreev said that Poland's stance towards Russia since the Ukraine crisis began on Feb. 24 was particularly hostile, compared to other international partners.

""They are projecting this image of the most unfriendly country towards Russia, in NATO, in the EU, in Europe,"" he said.

Poland's decision to expel the Russian diplomats followed similar decisions in the Baltic states and Bulgaria.

"Two arrested after kidnappers demand $10K or they’ll ‘cut up’ teen, AK cops say","An Amber Alert has been issued for a 17-year-old girl Arkansas police say has been abducted and being held for ransom after leaving work at a bakery on April 18. The teens’ abductors are demanding $10,000 for her return.

Trynytee Case was last seen leaving work at the Hot Springs bakery, Pour Some Sugar on Me, at around 9:15 p.m. on April 18, police said in the Amber Alert.

Case and a co-worker were walking to their cars after leaving work, and were met by a woman who asked Case if she could use her cellphone, police said.

The stranger told Case and her co-worker that she was lost, and needed to find where her parents were staying in Hot Springs. She asked Case if she could come closer to the unknown woman’s car so she could use her GPS coordinates, according to the Amber Alert, which was issued on April 19.

The co-worker then told Case she was going to get her car in a nearby parking garage, but when she returned, Case was nowhere to be found, the alert said.

After Case’s mother tried to call her multiple times, the 17-year-old answered and said “Everything is fine.” A man then told her mother on the phone that he wants $10,000 for Case’s return, or she will be killed and “cut up,” according to the Amber Alert.

The phone then went dead, and was last pinged headed south of Hot Springs on U.S. highway 7, police said.

HOW OUR FLAG MEANS DEATH’S CREATOR MADE A PERIOD ROMANCE DISGUISED AS A PIRATE COMEDY,"For many people, Our Flag Means Death was an unexpected history lesson about the adventures of Stede Bonnet, the real 18th-century pirate who loved the high seas almost as much as he loathed the “discomforts” of married life with his wife. Our Flag Means Death’s first season often leaned into the absurd as it followed Rhys Darby’s interpretation of Bonnet putting together a crew of vagabonds willing to serve under a soft and inexperienced member of the landed gentry playing a pirate. But what makes the show’s story work — aside from how much of it really does borrow elements from the real Bonnet’s life — is how it’s really only about piracy in the most roundabout sense.

Surprised as many viewers were to learn that the real Stede and Blackbeard did spend a significant amount of time traveling together, what ended throwing many of Our Flag Means Death’s viewers for a loop was the revelation that its Stede and Blackbeard were falling in love. Of all the clever tricks — or fuckery, if you’d prefer — Our Flag Means Death managed to pull off, few were impressive as its ability to disguise the fact that it was a period romance all along, something series creator David Jenkins partially attributes to the expectations we bring to TV. When we spoke with Jenkins recently, he said that while it’s been great watching fans embrace Our Flag Means Death, the surprised responses to its character arcs speak to the importance of using genre fiction to better reflect and play with the realities of our world.

Before we talk about Stede and Ed, let’s talk about David and Taika as showrunner and executive producer.

David Jenkins: For me, the joy of having an EP like Taika is that you know he’s there and is going to come direct the pilot, but then he just leaves me alone, and I get to make the show as weird as I want to make it. We get to take it in the writers room in directions that interest us, and no one’s trying to get in there and fuck with it too much. The great thing about Taika is that he comes back. He does actually direct the pilot — he doesn’t float away — and he decides that it’s well-written enough that he wants to be in it. And then he performs your fucking writing!

There’s moments of improvisation, but like the amount that he’s served those scripts and the amount that he’s served my vision for what the show should be is humbling. When you’re looking at this person who’s incredible and it’s like, “Ah, man. They’re playing my notes. Oh my god, this is incredible.” It’s immensely gratifying.

Is that something one hopes for, but one doesn’t bank on happening?

It’s rare, but I think that’s why he’s a very good producer. I don’t know a ton about his relationship with Sterlin [Harjo] on Reservation Dogs, but that’s Sterlin’s thing. He conceived it with Taika, but Sterlin is the driving force behind that show and what it looks like, and I think part of being a good producer is knowing when to go away and when to come back. Setting people up whose sensibilities you like, and then championing them, and supporting them without trying to control it too much is an amazing skill that I think very few people of his stature have.

What is it about Our Flag Means Death that made it so easy for people to really sort of miss the early queer subtext that’s barely subtext?

I’m the wrong person to ask because I, well, I know a lot more now than I did a month ago, and I know a lot more now than I did two weeks ago based on how this show was going to roll out. I thought it was pretty clear to me that you get halfway through, and you’re like, “Oh, OK. These people have feelings for each other. And they’re attracted to each other.”

Little bit, yeah.

And it’s clear. I think I didn’t realize — because I see myself represented on camera, and I see myself falling in love in stories — I didn’t realize how deep the queer baiting thing goes. Being made to feel stupid by stories, I guess.

How do you mean?

As we were breaking the season and looking at how it would go, part of me knew that, yes, Stede and Ed’s romance was going to be real. But one part of me felt like, “We’re going to do this story, and they’re going to kiss, and maybe that’s not even going to be that big a deal. Maybe it’ll just be a blip.” But then, looking at how people were kind of afraid to let themselves believe that we were doing that was a surprise to me, and it’s heartbreaking.

I understand it much better now, and it’s like, oh, you were made to feel stupid by a bunch of shows — unintentionally, by and large, I think — but made to feel like “maybe I’m going to be up there. Maybe that’ll be me in this story.” And then at the end of it feeling like, “Aw. No, it’s not me. I’m not in this one.” That fucks with you at any age, I think, but especially when you’re young and impressionable. I know it would make me feel that I didn’t belong, and I think that’s part of where the response to the show comes from.

Take me back to when you were first breaking the season and carving out your take on Stede and Ed. What was the key to building out romance between the two of them that felt organic and honest to them both? Not as historical figures but as characters taking shape in your mind?

I’d never written a romance before this one, but I think with Ed and Stede, the question’s always “what’s the need for each other?” I think the need for Stede is pretty apparent in the beginning because he’s just this poor man who doesn’t know at all what he’s doing. Ed, I think, is at a point in his life where he needs to see somebody who’s a bit of an outsider artist who has a fresh take on piracy. Once you figure out what these kinds of characters are missing — what they’re looking for in each other — their stories start to take on their own lives, and they reveal things to you. Like, Stede’s such a great character because he unwittingly seduces this person by being his neat self and doing stuff in a slightly different way.

This is the first time I’ve heard anyone talk about the show through the Stede-as-seducer lens, but you’re totally right. There’s that one line where he asks Blackbeard if he “fancies a fine fabric,” and it killed me because that’s a whole 18th-century pickup line. He’s cruising.

It’s an unintentional seduction, I think, but yeah.

Talk to me about that — the unintentionality of Stede’s seduction and leading with that from a writing perspective.

It’s just that undeniable chemistry between two people falling in love at first sight, essentially. When they see each other, it’s that Beach Boys “Our Prayer” song that our editor Daniel Haworth pitched, and it’s just fantastic in that moment. I don’t know. I love looking at them as having a modern relationship where, you know, maybe you’ve heard about each other before you met, and then you’re kind of into what the other person’s doing, and then it turns out that they’re into what you’re doing. And then you see each other, and there’s chemistry?

But then also, I think there’s something interesting about an amateur going up against the ultimate professional. I’m sure you’ve seen it, too — you’re overworked. But when you see someone who’s writing for fun, and you’re fucking tired and jaded, and you had a bunch of stupid shit happen, but you see that people who’s still feeling it? You remember, “Oh, right. That’s why I do it. This is what I need to get back to. Like, what the fuck? What am I doing?”

Definitely.

I think “do you fancy a fine fabric” is unintentional, but it’s when he tucks the fabric into Blackbeard’s shirt and tells him that he wears fine things well that makes it work. That’s such a kind thing to say and such a perceptive thing for him to say in that moment, and sometimes you meet somebody and you can just see them like that.

You’ve talked in the past about framing Stede as a really naive person with an immature sense of love before meeting Ed because he’d just never really experienced it before. What about Ed’s sense of love and romance, though? He’s this worldly person who’s already exhausted and put upon by his life Pre-Gentleman Pirate.

Yeah, I think they’re both very undeveloped in certain ways, but I think this is Ed’s first time falling in love, too, honestly. He’s more experienced, and he’s, I think, probably more physically experienced than Stede. But they’re these two middle-aged men who are underdeveloped in a certain way in terms of romantic emotional health as we understand it. It made sense to have that love be almost like a teenage version of falling in love — one with all these intense and conflicting feelings. They’re middle-aged, but Stede’s young. Ed’s young. Emotionally, they’re like 16, and they’ve both got a lot to learn.

I want to talk to you about the final episode of the first season and that sort of pointed change that we see both of them go through once that classic misunderstanding has sort of been introduced, right? Stede’s “Crap, I do love him. I have to go get him.” Ed’s like, “He’s left me.” And that sort of feels as if they’ve branched off into two defined states that aren’t just going to be temporary. In that moment when they are sort of not in sync with each other anymore, what do they mean to each other?

I mean, I think it’s two sides of the same coin, which is why we use montage a couple of times at the end of that episode, and why it was important to me that it was scripted that way. Stede’s realizing he’s in love and finding out that he is actually in love is a surprise to him. It didn’t even occur to him that he got it right, and then Mary has to kind of tell him. I think Blackbeard feels like he’s never been rejected in this way before. So in a weird way, Stede’s feeling love — like a more mature version of love than he’s ever felt, and Blackbeard’s feeling a more profound, mature version of rejection. Because he’s never put himself out there like this, and it’s deranging him because he’s a highly emotional person.

There’s so many moments where Izzy’s opposition to Stede can be read as like, “Please stop fucking with my boss. You’re ruining our good thing here,” but that in and of itself also reads as a form of love between Izzy and Ed. As you were building out Izzy’s arc, what were the really important beats that you wanted for him to sort of land on as he keeps sort of being this thorn in the side of this burgeoning romance?

I think the key was casting Con. The part was written before we got him, and then we had a few scripts left to go, and I knew we had Con, and I would actually watch his audition to get back to Izzy’s center. He plays an exhausted quality that’s really lovely because this character could just be generically evil, and the way Con plays, it is like, he’s credible. I believe that he can do some damage if he wanted to. My favorite thing I’ve seen about the show is somebody saying that Con’s playing the only human with a bunch of Muppets. It does feel like that a bit where he’s like Charles Grodin in The Great Muppet Caper.

There’s a lot of Muppet Treasure Island here.

Yeah! And then and then, at the same time, I think Izzy’s deeply in love with Blackbeard, and it’s a very dysfunctional kind of love, and he’s like the jilted spouse who’s losing his man to fucking Stede Bonnet, and he can’t believe this is happening.

So much of this show is about romance, but it’s also like a very clever deconstruction of our ideas about masculinity. What sort of conversations did you have with the other writers about making sure that this was always going to be a show about pirates inhabiting different modes of being as opposed to, you know, Men On the High Seas?

I feel like, particularly over the last five years, we’ve been treated to this burlesque of masculinity.

How do you mean?

Well, it’s meaningless, but you look at people going “look at President [Trump],” and they’re drawing him like a stereotypical macho man, but in actuality, he’s this doughy sack of shit in a suit. You look at Fox News, which is also an interesting burlesque of straight femininity and masculinity, but it’s done through this really distorted, almost pro-wrestling-like lens. It always felt oppressive to me growing up, and now we’ve hit this place where some people are really trying to hang onto these outdated ideas about gender, but society’s actually moving on and past them. I think just to take this very hetero, whitewashed genre and write into it more of what it actually was. There were a lot of pirates who were genderfluid, like Anne Bonny and Mary Read, who were doing the pirate thing before anyone was really talking about women getting into piracy. And then, as we were writing more into the ship’s queer culture, we realized that this is just more of what it was.

Do you think of the show as a reexamination of the record in that sense?

Well, no, because at the same time, you wouldn’t want to meet the real Blackbeard. The real Blackbeard was a rapist who handed women over to his crew. The real Stede Bonnet was a slave owner. When we tell these stories, we have to be clear with what we’re doing because all of these people were despicable. To make a fictionalized version of this history, though, I think you have to try to staff a room where people have lived-in experiences that they can bring to the story, and we have to talk about things we’re experiencing now because these stories are timeless.

In talking to the room while we were building it, we kept asking, “What do we want the show to be?” And the consensus in that very diverse room was that we wanted to show that isn’t just wallowing in trauma. We don’t have to do a coming out scene or focusing on the trauma of it — not to say that those stories aren’t valid. But we wanted a show where these characters can exist in a fantasy world and their race or gayness doesn’t automatically lead to a traumatic storyline for them. We have a lot of shows where...

That’s the point?

Yeah, someone’s sexuality in a period piece is met with dire consequences. We have a lot that, you know? So what if we just didn’t do it.

When you meet the nun who raised Jim in “This Is Happening,” she’s so matter-of-fact about them having always been more or less the way they are and raising them to seek revenge.

We had so many different permutations of the nun, and it was just great. Like, I’m old, man, so when I’m talking about these things, I’m trying to keep up with everyone and understand and ask the right questions. When you staff your room well, they’ll lead you there if you listen and say, “What can we do with this nun beyond the obvious?”

I feel like that’s very much a thing creators talk about now — the importance of making sure that their rooms have that kind of dynamism and diversity in them, but I’m curious to hear what those things mean to you as the creator of something like Our Flag Means Death.

I don’t know how anyone else does it, but for me, I think gender balance is great in a room, and non-binary writers are a part of that. The first thing is, can you write? Do I want to go on a 20-week car trip with you and vice versa? “Yes, and” is the most important thing in the room because if you get people who are “no, but,” the work is heavier on everyone’s shoulders, and then it is really just being like, “Who were the most interesting writers out there?” There is a demographic component to it that I think people shy away from, but it is what it is. I know that I want X, Y and Z perspectives in the room.

The show about the slave-owning pirate should probably have some people of color in the writers’ room.

Right, and it’s not checking off a diversity list with a golf pencil but really being honest with yourself and asking, “Do I have the perspectives and terms of race, gender, sexuality to create a shared sociological imagination?” It’s fucked up because you write a show and a lot of the plaudits go to you, the showrunner, and it’s like you’re using all of these brains. You know, you have this horsepower of all of these writers like this. The season is the function of all of these brains coming together and creating one sociological imagination.

The streaming service formerly known as IMDb TV is rebranding to ‘Amazon Freevee’,"After launching as “IMDb Freedive” back in 2019, IMDb TV quickly faded into the background of the ongoing streaming wars that parent company Amazon had already established a respectable foothold in. While that initial rebrand never quite managed to put the fledgling platform and its content on the map, Amazon’s just announced its plan to reintroduce the streamer yet again under new branding ahead of a massive content push.

Going forward, IMDb TV will be known as “Amazon Freevee,” a name meant to emphasize that the ad-supported platform is free to viewers. In a press release detailing its vision for Freevee’s future, director Ashraf Alkarmi framed the service as a supplemental platform meant to appeal to consumers interested in watching “premium” series and films with significantly fewer commercial interruptions.

“Customers are increasingly shifting to streaming ad-supported premium content, and we have developed Freevee to deliver them highly sought content with half the commercials of traditional TV,” Alkarmi said. “Our new name clearly communicates who we are: An easy-to-navigate streaming service, available to users for free, whenever and wherever they choose to watch some of the greatest Original and licensed content available.”

Though Freevee will feature a certain amount of licensed content, the streamer’s banking on its original programming like Bosch: Legacy and a scripted adaptation of Tegan and Sara’s High School memoir from Clea DuVall. While Freevee plans to grow its slate of original programming by 70 percent by the end of the year, what’s going to ultimately determine the platform’s success is whether people end up watching it. It’s certainly possible that the third time will be the charm for Amazon Freevee, but at this mature and intense stage of the larger streaming game, a wealth of content doesn’t necessarily ensure success.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23023835/imdb-tv-amazon-freevee-rebrand,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/NoFjb-eQGgxaxKXDm7vkQmBrtuI=/0x25:1357x735/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23387407/Freevee.jpeg,Verge,"After launching as “IMDb Freedive” back in 2019, IMDb TV quickly faded into the background of the ongoing streaming wars that parent company Amazon had already established a respectable foothold in.

Peacock’s new Queer as Folk reboot debuts this June,"When Russell T. Davies’ original Queer as Folk first premiered on Channel 4 back in 1999, it made a name for itself with its frank and often joyful depictions of queer lives with a particular focus on sex. Showtime’s 2000 adaptation led with a similar focus that established its spin on Queer as Folk as a cultural phenomenon and changed the landscape of American TV. Now, Peacock’s banking that the Queer as Folk brand still has enough of that old magic to make its upcoming reboot stand out in an era when networks and streaming services have long since come around to the idea of telling sexy stories about queer club goers.

Today, Peacock released a new teaser along with details and a series of images from Stephen Dunn’s Queer as Folk, a reimagining of both its predecessors. Though the teaser doesn’t actually feature any footage from the show, it establishes that the new Queer as Folk will once again revolve around a club called Babylon, where a number of its characters’ lives intersect.

Grid View











In a press release about the series, Dunn recalled how he, like many ’90s queer kids, grew up watching Queer as Folk and immediately being struck simply being seeing a television show that gave queer characters the space and freedom to be fully formed people. Though the new show is definitely taking cues from its predominantly white predecessors, Dunn noted that this Queer as Folk’s creative team took care to build its story with the queer community’s actual diversity in mind.

“I wanted to create a new groundbreaking version of this show for this moment,” Dunn said. “Our new Queer as Folk is set in New Orleans — one of the most unique queer communities in North America — and I am immensely proud that the new series is comprised of an electric ensemble of fresh characters that mirror the modern global audience.”

Queer as Folk stars Devin Way, Fin Argus, Jesse James Keitel, Candace Grace, Johnny Sibilly, and Ryan O’Connell.

Davies’ original Queer as Folk first premiered on Channel 4 back in 1999, it made a name for itself with its frank and often joyful depictions of queer lives with a particular focus on sex. Now, Peacock’s banking that the Queer as Folk brand still has enough of that old magic to make its upcoming reboot stand out in an era when networks and streaming services have long since come around to the idea of telling sexy stories about queer club goers."
RUSSIAN DOLL LEVELS UP IN SEASON 2 BY CATCHING A NEW EXISTENTIAL TRAIN OF THOUGHT,"As Nadia Vulvokov realized how she was trapped in a never-ending cycle of death and do-overs in Russian Doll’s first season, her familiarity with the concept of time loops helped her escape one. Nadia’s self-awareness about her predicament was a major part of what kept Russian Doll from feeling like a simple Groundhog Day riff with little to add to the genre. That cosmic knowingness is also one of the reasons Russian Doll’s second season makes for such an unexpectedly different and fascinating puzzle box as it takes the series to its next level with another tale of metaphysical birthday madness.

Russian Doll’s second season picks up a few years after the previous and just days before Nadia’s (Natasha Lyonne) 40th birthday. As always, Nadia fully intends to spend the day of her birth with loved ones like Maxine (Greta Lee) and Ruth (Elizabeth Ashley), and she’s confident that she’s going to be able to make good on her plans because — for the first time in a while — she feels in control of her life.

More than any specific setting details, it’s Nadia’s interactions with neighborhood pillars like Horse (Brendan Sexton III) and bodega owner Farran (Ritesh Rajan) that give you a sense of how much everyone has lived in the gap between Russian Doll’s first and second seasons. After spending the past few of Nadia’s birthdays together and on high alert in case they were sucked into another loop, she and Alan (Charlie Barnett) have had the chance to develop a genuine friendship and shared sense of safety with one another that helps keep them both grounded.

Russian Doll pads its story with a healthy dose of urban legends

Despite Alan and Nadia having more than earned their right to be in perpetual states of anxiety about their places in the universe, Russian Doll’s second chapter leads with the idea that their previous experiences have changed them for the better. Neither Nadia nor Alan’s neuroses are ever all that far away, though, and a substantial part of Russian Doll’s story here is a mind-bending exploration of how the two of them got to be that way in the first place. Similar to how the new season of Russian Doll doesn’t spend as much time reminding you that Nadia’s a video game developer, the show doesn’t try to frame its new time-traveling conceit as a surprise. Rather, Russian Doll presents it as the universe challenging both Alan and Nadia to better understand themselves and how uniquely situated in reality they’ve always been.

Russian Doll once again presumes that you, like Nadia, have consumed enough stories about time travel to know the rules about what people should and shouldn’t do if they spontaneously find themselves transported to the distant past. Season two raises the stakes and puts a unique spin on the genre, though, by padding its story with a healthy dose of urban legends and batshit left turns that all complement Lyonne’s performance as a consummate New Yorker who — mostly — knows no fear.

The importance of living in the moment is one of the larger ideas that shapes much of Russian Doll’s plot as Nadia and Alan begin bouncing back and forth between the present day and important moments from their past that are somehow connected by New York’s subway system. In any other series, the absurdity of a time-traveling MTA train guiding people to crucial points in their lives might almost be enough to derail the entire endeavor, but it works here because of this season’s focus on how nonsensical things become important parts of people’s identities.

Though much of this season is about Nadia looking back on her life, Russian Doll also delves into her interiority by way of her mother, Lenora (Chloë Sevigny), a paranoid schizophrenic with her own history of moving through the world in ways that “normal” people don’t. Russian Doll’s first season gave us a taste of what Nadia’s childhood with Lenora was like, but season 2 is a proper study of what it meant for Lenora to be a single mother in the ’80s struggling to support a family with few resources at her disposal. Both Lyonne — who also serves as showrunner — and Sevigny bring Nadia and Lenora to life with a raw intensity that feels new despite it gelling with what we’ve seen of the characters in the past.

While Russian Doll’s taking on a slightly different kind of sci-fi / supernatural trope this season, what’s pleasantly surprising is how uninterested the series is in deconstructing said trope outside of a handful of jokes. Russian Doll knows that you’ve probably seen Back to the Future and thought about what sorts of investments you’d want to make if you woke up in the past, which is why it spends so much of its time pushing you and its protagonists to think more deeply about what’s happening to them.

The more you settle into the Murakami-like pacing and sensibilities of Russian Doll’s new mystery, the more satisfying this seven-episode-long season ends up being as it begins to increasingly rely on a fuzzy kind of dream logic. The clarity that Nadia and Alan are initially able to view their situations with doesn’t endure, but it’s replaced by a perspective that’s far more interesting and leaves open the possibility for even more Russian Doll down the line.","Charles Pulliam-Moore, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/13/23020726/russian-doll-season-2-review-netflix,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9h4kL0jY1mr3XC4z5AWOyXn788o=/0x124:2759x1569/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23382455/RussianDoll_Season2_Episode1_00_21_43_18R.jpeg,Verge,"As Nadia Vulvokov realized how she was trapped in a never-ending cycle of death and do-overs in Russian Doll’s first season, her familiarity with the concept of time loops helped her escape one.

Stranger Things 4’s new trailer teases a guitar battle in the Upside Down,"Even though we’ve seen a few teasers of Stranger Things’ upcoming fourth season, none of them really let on just how much larger and epic in scope this next chapter seems like it’s going to be.

While Stranger Things has explored the larger world outside of Hawkins, Indiana, in the past, the show’s fourth season is set to switch things up by splitting its story across a handful of disparate, important locations. Though the story will presumably return to the Upside Down and catch up with Jim Hopper in Russia, Stranger Things’ first season four trailer makes clear that a significant part of its next chapter will unfold in California, where Joyce and the rest of the Byers family have moved.

Severance’s first season is a wonderfully tense workplace horror story,"In the age of binge-watching and television seasons that drop all at once, Severance feels unique: it’s a show you definitely don’t want to watch in one go. Despite the veneer of a banal workplace drama, Severance is an incredibly tense sci-fi horror series where that tension only builds over the course of the show’s nine episodes. Each new chapter is a chance to see something more messed up and discover the dark depths the capitalist machine is willing to sink to. You’re going to want some space in between to let it all soak in — and maybe catch your breath a little.

This article contains spoilers for the first season of Severance.

Severance starts out fairly slowly. The show centers on a relatively new procedure called, naturally, severance, which splits a worker’s brain in two. This allows people to essentially skip work for eight hours a day and focus on their outside life. The work self, meanwhile (the two are colloquially referred to as “innies” and “outies”), is stuck in a life that is nothing but work. Their entire lives are contained to the office. The technology allows memories to be spatially dictated. Your life and memories are yours right up until you hop in the elevator at Lumon Industries, go down to the severed floor, and get to work. From that point on, your time and memories belong to your innie — and to Lumon.

Related The weird computers and claustrophobic hallways of Severance

We’re introduced to the concept through Mark (Adam Scott). On the outside, Mark is grieving the loss of his wife, and he signed up to be severed in hopes of avoiding those feelings for at least part of the day. On the inside, he’s the chipper department head of the macrodata refinement division at Lumon, where he and three other employees — Dylan (Zach Cherry), Helly (Britt Lower), and Irving (John Turturro) — spend all day long doing… something. It’s never actually clear what their job is, though they’re reassured the work is mysterious and important. It mostly involves finding “scary” numbers on a bewildering grid.

Initially, it’s easy to see the appeal of severing. Work sucks. Who wouldn’t want to cut that drudgery out of their lives and focus on the good parts? But it quickly becomes clear just how untenable the solution is. For the innies, it’s an actual nightmare. Their lives exist only within the dreary walls of Lumon’s basement. When they leave work, their next memory is of arriving the next day. They feel the effects of sleep, but they never experience it themselves. Things get so bleak that collecting office trinkets like Lumon-branded finger traps becomes an actual incentive. At one point, a contraband book of New Age philosophical gibberish makes its way into the department, and the refiners treat it like the most important piece of literature ever written. After all, when the only thing you’ve ever read is an employee handbook, anything would be good by comparison.

The sense of discomfort — and, eventually, outright terror — grows as the show progresses, and you learn more about Lumon and what life is like in the basement. The company itself is a bit like if Amazon was run by Scientologists, only a lot more evil. We’re told that it’s a pharmaceutical company with its hands in a lot of different industries. Much of the staff — at least those we see, including Mark’s boss, played with a terrifying intensity by Patricia Arquette — worship its founder like a religious figure, right down to the constant repetition of dogma. In the optics and design division, you can find, among other disturbing Romantic era-style paintings of interdepartmental wars, a version of Wanderer above the Sea of Fog, featuring Lumon founder Kier Eagan staring out into the great unknown.

Severance thrives on mystery. Like Lost and Yellowjackets, it’s a show that loves to toss inexplicable curveballs at viewers that are sometimes explained, sometimes not. In Severance, those strange twists are often the reason for the steadily creeping sense of dread. Some of this comes down to the way the show looks: the severed floor is like something out of a parallel dimension. It’s almost like a cubicle farm ripped out of the ‘60s, but with strange retrofuturistic computers, twisting hallways designed for maximum confusion, and a breakroom that doubles as a psychological torture chamber. Oh, and there’s a room filled with baby goats. It’s the kind of show where a celebratory waffle party inevitably devolves into something bizarre and uncomfortable.

This sense of mystery is amplified by the dual nature of the severed characters. Each actor is essentially playing two different people with conflicting desires. But by nature of their surgically altered brains, they only know half of the story. Outie Mark has no idea what really goes on during the hours he’s at the office, and innie Mark knows literally nothing about the outside world and the impact that widespread adoption of severance could have. You may be confused while watching, but the characters in the show have things much, much worse. I should also note that Severance’s creators have a clear love of artful cliffhangers of the “Not Penny’s boat” variety. This extends to the finale, which, while answering some important questions and offering some explosive revelations, also leaves a lot to be uncovered in Severance’s recently confirmed second season. You may shout at your screen when the credits kick in.

Put it all together, and you have a show that paints the darkest possible portrait of how megacorporations think about and treat their employees. We’ve all seen the stories of what tech giants try to get away with in the real world; Severance posits a future where they can do literally anything in secret because employees have knowingly signed up to be lab rats. If things go Lumon’s way, no one will ever know about the goats or the breakroom. That tension and terror are worth it, though. The first season of Severance is stressful, but it’s also a lot more fun than a Lumon-allocated Music Dance Experience.","Andrew Webster, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/23015650/severance-season-1-review-apple-tv-plus,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KyBKJ-LCJw74QxAqkaFLkF7DFkk=/391x0:3449x1601/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23375018/ATV_Severance_Photos_010503.jpg,Verge,"In the age of binge-watching and television seasons that drop all at once, Severance feels unique: it’s a show you definitely don’t want to watch in one go.

The weird computers and claustrophobic hallways of Severance,"In the vast underground office of Lumon, the megacorporation at the heart of Apple TV Plus’ thriller Severance, the computers are downright bizarre. At first they look a bit like an old Mac, but the closer you look, the more strange they become. The CRT display is somehow a touchscreen. The beautiful blue keyboard is saddled with a gigantic trackball. The goal, production designer Jeremy Hindle tells The Verge, was to design a device that doesn’t make a lot of sense, mirroring the purgatory-like world that exists only within Lumon’s basement. “The idea was that anything you could see underground doesn’t exist up top anywhere,” says Hindle. “You’ll never see that computer or that keyboard.”

This article contains light spoilers for Severance.

Severance takes place in a world where a new procedure — the titular severance — allows workers to split their lives in two after a little brain surgery. They essentially become two people: one who lives a relatively normal life and another whose entire existence resides in a purgatory-like office. Because of this, the design of the office itself was extremely important. It needed to feel like a place outside of time and space. “You have to make sure that the inside and outside world are [different] enough that you’re immersed in the world, so you feel like you’re severed when you’re down there with them,” explains Hindle.

The starting point was offices from the 1960s. “They’re working in this office environment, and they’re brought in to just be these pro-workers, and they’re birthed into the place,” Hindle says. “It should be like what offices used to be like. Beautiful desks, beautiful structures, beautiful lights. Just about work. On the desk there’s one pen, a rolodex, a phone. It felt like it had to be that same tone — but way more playful.”

At first glance, the offices in Severance look fairly normal. They’re brightly lit with clean white walls and carpeted green floors. But in the macrodata refinement wing — where much of the show takes place — things are a little off. Despite having a huge room, the four workers are crammed together via a cluster of desks in the middle of the space. From there, things get even stranger. The hallways, designed with the intention of making people lost, twist and turn in confusing ways, and there are rooms filled with 3D printers and baby goats.

“It’s not a spaceship, but it is a spaceship.”

The breakroom, despite its name, is a bleak, dark place where employees are punished for breaking the rules. In order to access it, they’re forced down a long, narrow, and dimly lit hallway that’s barely wide enough for a single person. “The space is what makes people feel uncomfortable when they watch it,” says Hindle. “In [macrodata refinement] the ceiling is so low, so even though the room is a football field, it’s claustrophobic in a strange way.” (According to Hindle, series creator Dan Erickson once drew him a map of the labyrinth basement, which he describes as a “maze.”)

The next step was perfecting the smaller details because the underground office is meant to be its own little world. “It’s not a spaceship, but it is a spaceship,” Hindle says, citing the original Alien as a big source of inspiration. That meant that everything in it, from the desks with their adjustable dividers and the snacks in the vending machine to the finger traps given out as bonuses had to be created in-house. Hindle estimates that the production team designed around 100 different products to be used in the office, all meant to evoke the Lumon aesthetic.

Which takes us back to the computers. Those Lumon rigs, which employees use to find “scary” numbers in a Minesweeper-like program, look like they were hacked together from several other machines. “The trackball just cracked me up,” Hindle says. “We kept thinking, ‘If you’re experimenting with these people, what would you put in front of them?’” Not only were they designed to look out of time, but also to give the cast of office drones — which includes the likes of Adam Scott, Britt Lower, Zach Cherry, and a very charming John Turturro — something to play around with while acting. “Imagine how fun it would be to sit at this thing, as opposed to if I put a laptop in front of them,” Hindle says. “It’s like a child’s device.”

Hindle says that the computers are functional and that the actors are really messing with numbers on screen during the show. The machines also went through multiple revisions before production began to get the size just right (among other things), so that they were large enough to be a focal point but small enough to not obscure the actors or interfere with their eyelines. As Hindle notes, “They’re in this room for three hours in the first season. It had to be pretty special and pretty fun.”

When you combine all of these elements — the retrofuturistic computers, the labyrinth layout, the ‘60s decor, the claustrophobic hallways — and add in voyeuristic cinematography that’s often reminiscent of security camera footage, you end up with a show that’s both instantly familiar and uncomfortably strange. In these offices, even a dance party takes on a tinge of horror, which, given one of Hindle’s main inspirations, shouldn’t be too surprising.

“It really was my Twin Peaks,” he explains. “The similarity is that they have a tone to the writing, the art direction, the design, the cinematography. It is its own world.”","Andrew Webster, Apr",https://www.theverge.com/23013413/severance-apple-tv-plus-production-design-computers,https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/69ZuuiG44aHj_Yn9m_gVtzYd4EM=/0x591:8256x4914/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23371548/ATV_Severance_Photo_010203.jpg,Verge,"In the vast underground office of Lumon, the megacorporation at the heart of Apple TV Plus’ thriller Severance, the computers are downright bizarre.

A new Orphan Black series is in the works at AMC,"Though the original Orphan Black series seemingly brought the story of Sarah Manning (Tatiana Maslany) and her sprawling family tree of sister clones to a close, AMC’s gearing up to return to their world with an all-new live-action series.

Per The Hollywood Reporter, AMC Networks has tapped Fear The Walking Dead supervising producer Anna Fishko to write and showrun Orphan Black: Echoes, a new series set in the near future of the original. The new show, which is set to be executive produced and directed by John Fawcett, will follow the lives of a new group of women who gradually begin to realize how deeply interconnected their origins are — despite the fact that none of them know one another. Given how the original Orphan Black came to a close, it’s unclear whether Echoes will see Maslany return to reprise any of her core Clone Club roles or one of the dozens of other Leda clones that were still living out in the world by the series finale.

Star Trek: Picard is bringing back more Next Generation stars in its final season,"To answer the question of why we should care about Paramount Plus, the service is going back to the well of nostalgia and snagging some of our favorite Star Trek: The Next Generation characters to be featured in season 3 of Star Trek: Picard.

A brief trailer for the news shows just Patrick Stewart in his role as Jean-Luc Picard but uses voiceovers to tease the upcoming appearances of LeVar Burton, Michael Dorn, Jonathan Frakes, Gates McFadden, Marina Sirtis, and Brent Spiner.

Without showing them, it’s unclear if we’ll see the use of often-controversial de-aging technology applied to the stars or if there’s any other plan to deal with the impact of time and plot circumstances. Guinan’s return in season 2 has included both Whoopi Goldberg and a new performer, Ito Aghayere, assuming the role of young Guinan, as well as some timeline chicanery. So anything seems possible for William Riker, Beverly Crusher, Geordi La Forge, Deanna Troi, Worf, and Data.

The third season will be Picard’s last, and in a statement, showrunner and EP Terry Matalas says “it’s most fitting that the story of Jean-Luc Picard ends honoring the beginning, with his dearest and most loyal friends from the U.S.S. Enterprise.” Co-EP Christopher Monfette confirmed the third season finished filming last month.

There’s no release date mentioned for the show’s third season, although season 2 is still airing, with new episodes arriving each Thursday and episode 6 poised to drop this week.

Watch the first Halo episode for free on YouTube,"The live-action Halo show on Paramount Plus is already onto its second episode this week, but the first one is now available for free on YouTube. As long as you’re in the US, you can access the first episode of Halo on YouTube.

The Halo show is nothing like the games, and Verge video games reporter Ash Parrish, a self-confessed Halo lore hobbyist, says it “offers a far more compelling look at the Master Chief than anything the games have done so far.”

Halo stars Pablo Schreiber of American Gods as Master Chief, Natascha McElhone of Californication as Dr. Halsey, and Jen Taylor, the voice actress for Cortana in the Halo games, as Master Chief’s AI assistant. The show has already been renewed for a second season, and debuted on Paramount Plus on March 24th.

This isn’t the first time streaming services have tried to entice people into subscriptions with free episodes on YouTube. The pilot episode of the Star Trek: Picard series appeared on YouTube a couple of years ago, and Tuca & Bertie’s first episode of season two is also on YouTube free of charge.

"Obi-Wan Kenobi’s premiere will be two days late, but you’ll get two episodes at once","Disney’s highly anticipated Obi-Wan Kenobi Disney Plus series will now debut two days later than previously planned, but there will be two episodes available to watch instead of just one.

Obi-Wan Kenobi begins 10 years after the events of Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, in which Anakin Skywalker completed his transformation into Darth Vader. Hayden Christensen is back to reprise his role as Vader, which I cannot wait for — the potential for memes is great.

Game of Thrones spinoff House of the Dragon premieres August 21st,"HBO’s upcoming Game of Thrones spinoff, House of the Dragon, will debut on HBO and HBO Max on August 21st. The company announced the date Wednesday with a picture of what appears to be a hatching dragon egg — which hopefully means we’ll see at least one of the terrifying beasts in the upcoming show.

House of the Dragon is based on George R.R. Martin’s 2019 book Fire and Blood and is focused on, as the name suggests, House Targaryen. It’s set 200 years before the events of the hugely popular Game of Thrones, which featured Daenerys Targaryen as one of the main characters.

"TechCrunch+ roundup: VC ‘bottom feeders,’ valuation calculator, think like an investor","Farmers don’t get embarrassed when the price of corn drops; similarly, there’s no reason for startup founders to lose their joy because publicly traded tech stocks are undercutting their valuations.

If making as much money as you can is your primary goal, however, prepare to be disappointed. Accepting a down round or a smaller seed check isn’t a sign of failure — as it says in the Bible: the rain falls on the just, and the unjust.

“While the market has quickly turned to favor the buyers, the good news is that it isn’t broken,” according to Jeremy Abelson and Jacob Sonnenberg of Irving Investors.

In a TC+ guest post, they share a calculator for using growth metrics and public market valuations that can help founding teams “triangulate to a more company-specific enterprise value.”

The numbers don’t lie — for all but a few strong contenders, the IPO window is now closed.

But if you have an idea for a product or service that might be valuable to others, spending your days working for someone else is a questionable choice, no matter what’s happening in the stock market.

Cram downs are a character test for VCs and founders

Follow-on investors who take advantage of the closing IPO window to foist unfavorable terms on founders are “the bottom feeders of the venture capital business,” writes Steve Blank.

As the public markets contract and startup valuations follow suit, it’s common for entrepreneurs who have invested years of their lives into a startup to accept “take-it-or-leave-it” terms, says Blank, an adjunct professor at Stanford and senior fellow for Innovation at Columbia University.

Ultimately, “VCs will stop playing this game when founders stop negotiating.”

How to think like an investor: Understanding the actual cost of fundraising

Founders in fundraising mode are usually laser-focused on the task at hand, but now that valuations are a moving target, it might be useful to borrow an investor’s perspective.

“The presumption that a company knows what its investors expect with full clarity is a lofty one,” says Rebecca Mitchem, a partner at Neotribe Ventures.

In a post aimed at growth-stage entrepreneurs, Mitchem answers three questions:

How expensive is venture capital (as defined by the amount of dilution)? What financial milestones will investors expect me to reach between each raise? What are the more subjective milestones I need to hit to evidence I’m ready for the next raise?

Steer’s Anuja Sonalker explains the benefits of chasing the less glitzy side of autonomy

In the AV industry, the ultimate goal is to create vehicles that can operate in every situation that a human driver could navigate.

It’s a difficult problem to solve: driving is a collection of acquired and practiced skills – negotiating a traffic jam requires a much different set of skills than parallel parking.

“Nobody is going to solve everything. Everybody is going to master one area and then work with others to create that end-to-end ecosystem,” Steer Tech founder and CEO Anuja Sonalker told Rebecca Bellan.

In their interview, Sonalker discusses the importance of automotive cybersecurity, how automating the “endpoint” makes freight more efficient, and why focusing on less glamorous tech can help companies build better products.

MLB forays into the future with new tech for the old ball game

Baseball has come a long way since 1897, when a Princeton math professor designed a pitching machine that ran on gunpowder.

Today, baseball is a technology-driven enterprise where team owners, players, media organizations and individual fans have access to reams of raw statistics.

To learn more about Major League Baseball’s tech stack, enterprise reporter Ron Miller interviewed its CPO and head of engineering, Vasanth Williams.

“MLB has a long history of leveraging data and technology, and being an early adopter of a lot of the technologies, which I love doing,” he said.

An inside look at a Ukrainian fintech startup adapting to life during wartime

In the 54 days since Russia began its invasion, Ukraine’s IT community has mobilized tools to assist its citizens and military, such as volunteering offices to house displaced citizens and helping employees move out of active war zones, writes Nelia Holovina, a senior content writer at 42Flows.Tech.

In a post for TechCrunch+, Holovina explains how shifting company operations to digital helped them prepare for the war and maintain productivity, even as many workers have put down laptops and picked up arms.

“It is believed that demand for IT will remain high, and the IT sector itself may become the new driver of the economy,” she writes. “The situation depends entirely on how long this war will last and how it will end.”

Netflix Preps Bigger Password-Sharing Crackdown,"Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing around the world, with the company telling shareholders Tuesday that it is a “big opportunity” for the streaming giant to help turn around its fortunes.

The company reported a quarterly subscriber loss Tuesday, ending Q1 of 2022 with 221.64 million subscribers, down from 221.84 million in Q4 of 2021.

In its shareholder letter, Netflix cited “the large number of households sharing accounts” as a critical factor “creating revenue growth headwinds.” Specifically Netflix estimates that “over 100 million” households worldwide are using shared Netflix accounts, including more than 30 million in the U.S. and Canada.

“This is a big opportunity as these households are already watching Netflix and enjoying our service,” the company wrote in its letter. “Sharing likely helped fuel our growth by getting more people using and enjoying Netflix. And we’ve always tried to make sharing within a member’s household easy, with features like profiles and multiple streams. While these have been very popular, they’ve created confusion about when and how Netflix can be shared with other households.”

Netflix began to test out potential password-sharing effort last year, and this March, the company rolled out a pilot program in Costa Rica, Peru and Chile that would let users add additional members outside of their households if the company ID’ed that a password was being shared.

On Tuesday, the company left no doubt that the crackdown will expand in the near future.

“There’s a broad range of engagement when it comes to sharing households from high to occasional viewing,” the company said. “So while we won’t be able to monetize all of it right now, we believe it’s a large short- to mid-term opportunity.”

Still, Netflix noted that “account sharing as a percentage of our paying membership hasn’t changed much over the years,” but added that the COVID-spurred subscriber pull-forward obscured the impact that password sharing had on its business.",Alex Weprin,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/netflix-password-sharing-crackdown-coming-1235132170/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/GettyImages-869378032-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter,"Netflix is preparing to crack down on password sharing around the world, with the company telling shareholders Tuesday that it is a “big opportunity” for the streaming giant to help turn around its fortunes.

‘Thor: Love and Thunder’ Trailer Hammers Out 209M Views in 24 Hours,"A lot of cosmic eyeballs were on the Thor: Love and Thunder teaser that dropped Monday.

The first look at the upcoming Marvel Cinematic Universe installment received over 209 million views in its first 24 hours of release, across all digital platforms.

That puts the preview in the top tier of Marvel trailers for most views in a day, behind Avengers: Infinity War (230 million) and Avengers: Endgame (289 million). However, the crown still belongs to Spider-Man: No Way Home, which raked in an astonishing 355.5 million views in its first 24 hours.

Backed by the Guns N’ Roses’ classic “Sweet Child O’ Mine,” the Marvel Studios teaser is nearly two minutes long. It opens with Thor (Chris Hemsworth) getting back into amazing shape after the God of Thunder packed on a few pounds during a five-year time jump in Avengers: Endgame.

The bright, stylish trailer sets the tone for the film in true Taika Waititi form, who directed the popular Thor: Ragnarok and returned to the director’s chair for Love and Thunder. The film will also feature the Guardians of the Galaxy and Tessa Thompson reprising her fan-favorite role as Valkyrie.

Of course, the biggest moment in the trailer is the conclusion, when Natalie Portman’s Jane Foster is unveiled as Mighty Thor.

"Director Mo Marable Talks ‘Woke,’ ‘Killing It’ and Working With Michelle Obama","A longtime creative exec, Mo Marable was best known for directing TV titles (see Big Love and the enduringly familiar Entourage opener) before the most unlikely of breaks got him behind the camera of narrative comedies such as The Game, Miracle Workers and Insecure.

It was a short for the 2014 White House Correspondents’ Dinner, the one where Julia Louis-Dreyfus and then-Vice President Joe Biden darted around D.C. in a cameo-filled parody, that changed the course of his career. Now a producing director on two series — Hulu’s Woke, which recently dropped its entire second season, and Peacock’s Killing It, which just premiered on April 14 — Marable has now worked on nearly 20 series and become a go-to choice for comedy pilots. Zooming in from the Nova Scotia shoot of Hulu’s Washington Black adaptation in early April, the director spoke about his trajectory, the increasingly polarizing idea of “wokeness” and hopes for his feature debut: a Disney+ update of 1980s comedy Three Men and a Baby.

It only recently came to my attention that you were the one who directed that insane White House Correspondents’ Dinner video with our now president and Julia Louis-Dreyfus. How’d you land that?

How I got there was crazy. I used to work at HBO, in the creative services promo department, but I had left and started my own production company. HBO, no matter who’s there, will always be family to me. They called me to do a promo for Veep, and I was like, “I don’t do promos anymore.” But then, of course, I shot it. Three weeks later I get a call for another Veep thing. “Just read it,” they said. So, I did, but I go, “Who are we going to get to play Joe Biden?” Turns out: Joe Biden. How do you say “no” to that? Next thing I know, I’m in D.C. and walking around the Oval Office. Every location we had, whether it was in The White House or Congress or whatever, we only had 15 minutes to shoot. I remember at one point the Obamas’ dog [Bo or Sunny] runs in and stops, looks at me, and then just walks out. “Wrong brother,” I said, “Wrong brother.”

Going into this, you’d worked with Julia — but obviously not with Joe Biden or Michelle Obama, who made a memorable cameo.

Working with Julia and [Veep creator] Armando Iannucci, we just hunkered down for like three or four days and created this piece together. But we had a lot of pivots, like the First Lady. We got a call on the second day saying, “Michelle Obama wants in.” And you already know what happens. She’s all about fitness and eating healthy, but she’s eating all of that ice cream. We had 15 minutes to shoot that. One thing I will say about Michelle Obama is that she has such a spirit and an energy. You can feel it far away. So we’re in there, and The White House assistants were just like, “She’ll be ready in five minutes… two minutes…” all of a sudden all these secret service men are in the room. I don’t know if I’m making this up, because it’s just the way I thought I saw her, but she came in and she was like, “Hey!”

When she hit her time limit, I needed one more shot to make it all work. “Ma’am, is it OK if I just shoot this one shot?” And Joe Biden lit me up. “She is the First Lady of the United States! You just can’t ask her that!” And Michelle just goes, “Joe.” She turns to me and says, “Mo, what do you need?” She says it’s fine, and then Joe just smiles. It was such a wonderful experience, and that was the narrative turning point of my career.

You really started racking up credits at that point.



That hit on Saturday night, during Correspondents’ Dinner, and then it was all over the news. That Monday I got a phone call to direct a TV show. It happened, just like that.

You hear a lot about directors shifting from music videos to TV and features but not from branded content. Do you think that you would’ve been able to segue into the career you have now without that moment?



I don’t know. My goal was always to become a director. When you’re young, you just think like everything’s possible. You don’t even know what the game is. You don’t know that some of this is inside baseball or nepotism. Not everybody who works hard and does good work gets to win. I got to a point where I was just satisfied that I wasn’t broke. “Oh, I can go on a vacation with my friends? Well, if I don’t ever do narrative, that’s cool.” But the reality is I never doubted that I was going to transition at some point.

The very first show they gave me a shot was The Game, Mara [Brock] and Salim Akil. That was the first phone call I got the day after the Correspondents’ Dinner thing came out. And in this business, you need somebody to vouch for you. You need somebody to say, “Take that shot.” Then I directed Veep, which I think would’ve happened anyway because of the short. From there it was It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia and things just picked up.

Since Woke originally premiered almost two years ago — and the timing of it is still kind of surreal, since that long-ignored conversation really came to the fore that summer — some things have changed and simultaneously nothing has change. But one big development is the that term “woke” has been weaponized by the right.

When we sold the show, and again when we were getting ready to market it, we had a lot of meetings around, “Should we keep the name Woke?” Woke was already starting to feel overused. We batted all of these other ideas around, but at the end of the day we kept coming back to Woke. It was timely, because people were paying attention. Like you said, it’s always been there. Sadly, between George Floyd and a pandemic, there were just so many things at play. We were actually supposed to premiere the show maybe six weeks or eight weeks later — during election week, I think! Hulu was a real partner for doing everything to push it forward, throwing money at marketing to get it all going. But the word “woke” has been twisted and co-opted. It’s a slur in certain circles. That’s the reason our tagline this season is “Woke is a four-letter word.”

For sure, and the new season really gets into the complications of the term and even within the activist community.

It’s a racial slur and a kind of microaggression in certain areas. I don’t know who is proud of the word anymore — and I’m talking every group from the right to the left. What I think the show loves about it now is that it is so polarized. And the thing about wokeness is … can anybody truly be woke? After George Floyd happened, next thing you know there are corporations putting out so-called woke type messaging. Huh!? I had a neighbor bring over food after George Floyd was murdered. I remember standing in the yard by the porch and my wife was out front and I just saw it coming. Here’s the casserole. Then I heard, “I’m so sorry.” I was like, “I don’t fucking know Floyd like that! I’m not at the wake.” The symbol of what happened galvanized me, galvanized a lot of people, but then I’d get a phone call from somebody who I hadn’t worked with in 20 years, someone I don’t really know, saying “Hey, if you can, can you give me a call back? I just really want to talk to you, man.” Oh my God. I’m the one black friend for someone. So, part of Woke this season is about the misuse of the idea of wokeness. The idea that corporations try to co-opt it to make more money as a marketing tool. The idea that you can never really be woke. The idea that a lot of our woke leaders started making money.

The set-up for Killing It is almost too absurd to get into. How did you come to direct that pilot?



I had just done another pilot with Dan Goor, Grand Crew for NBC, so I read it and I just thought the script was hilarious — especially knowing that was Craig Robinson. It’s so weird. But I loved it because I never see these types of people — especially people of color and women — in this kind of space. Who’s going to think that Craig Robinson is going to play a snake hunter in the Florida bayous? Nobody. But this is what I’m trying to do nowadays. I’m now in a space where I really try to pick projects that actually have a social undercurrent. We’re talking about something. You may not see it right away, but if you start to pay attention, it’ll get closer and closer to you.

I’m not as outwardly political. Yes, I vote. I will go to a march. I will donate. If something in the workplace is not right, I’m going to speak up. But as a person out there, I’m not door-knocking. And sometimes I wonder: Am I doing enough? And I think where I do my best political work is in my work. At the end of the day, I really want to normalize African Americans and talk about the idea that the system is built to not allow everybody a piece of the pie.

Fewer and fewer people every year.

Every year. And [Robinson’s character] is just trying so hard to find a way to get his little plot of land. He’s not trying to be a criminal. He’s trying to do it the legit way, yet still he has a brother who’s like, “Nah, that’s not going to work.” It shows you this idea of how people get ahead. Being corrupt seems to have worked for a lot of people. Doing it the hard way hasn’t worked for some people, especially for people who have been marginalized already. I just find this tale of trying to achieve the American dream to be sad and real — even though we disguise it in all this crazy comedy.

You have to tell me something about your Three Men and a Baby reboot for Disney+. What’s your angle?

Well, here’s what I will say. I mean, again, I’m trying not to do anything that doesn’t speak to what’s going on in society today. When you go back and you watch the original Three Men and a Baby you go, “times have changed.”

Yes, hopefully these protagonists will have a different relationship with women,

Exactly. That’s a part of it. Zac Efron is still attached to play the lead. We are in the process of finishing up the script. I’m not making a Manhattan story. I making a Brooklyn story. It’s about these three guys, but guys are not as stupid as they were back in the day. The cast will be very diverse, that’s the only way I would do it, and we’ll see how Disney enjoys the script in the next six/seven weeks.

Will there be a reference to the weird ghost child cameo that was actually just the shadow of the cardboard cut-out of Ted Danson and a top hat?



If I get my druthers, yes. And I would love to have a cameo from one or all of them. I still want to pay homage to the original.",Mikey O'Connell,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/woke-killing-it-mo-marable-interview-1235131126/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MoMarable_4173_Erik-Umphery-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter,"A longtime creative exec, Mo Marable was best known for directing TV titles (see Big Love and the enduringly familiar Entourage opener) before the most unlikely of breaks got him behind the camera of narrative comedies such as The Game, Miracle Workers and Insecure.

Gekis, who manages Mercado’s estate and will oversee all projects that come through the deal. “Although Walter has passed on, his message about self-empowerment, self-acceptance and our interconnectedness with the universe live on in humankind and need to be celebrated daily. Love, spirituality, generosity and goodwill are universal, and become more and more relevant with each passing day. Walter was a man ahead of his time, and the time has come for the rest of us to catch up with him.”



Gekis will exec produce any and all potential projects alongside Derbez and his 3Pas Studios’ Ben Odell and Sonia Almanza Gambaro. ARGHP’s Andy Fraser and Katie Politanoff will oversee for the company.

“I have always deeply admired Walter and am personally thrilled to have the opportunity to honor his legacy of love, hope and positivity,” said Derbez, whose bilingual production company 3Pas remains based at Lionsgate (English-language films) and Televisa Univision streamer ViX (Spanish-language fare). 3Pas’ credits include Overboard, How to be a Latin Lover, Acapulco and the upcoming The Valet.

Mercado’s nieces, Aida Benet Suarez, Betty Benet Mercado, Dannette Benet Mercado and Ivonne Benet Mercado, control the Mercado estate, Shanti LLC. The latter trio continue to publish horoscopes and other astrology under the banner of Las Estrellas de Walter. “All of Walter’s nieces are excited that 3Pas Studios and Eugenio Derbez along with Andy Fraser and A Really Good Home Pictures will work together to help carry on our uncle Walter’s message of love, positivity and inclusion and introduce his legacy to new generations,” said Dannette Benet Mercado.

“I knew that we would need a partner with strong connections to Walter’s legacy — one that would also respect and continue to spread the love and community that Walter championed in life. 3Pas Studios, with Eugenio, Ben and Sonia, is an excellent fit and I’m thrilled they came on board,” said Fraser.

Man Who Pleaded Guilty to Murder of Jacqueline Avant Gets 190-Year Prison Term,"Music executive Clarence Avant (L) and Jacqueline Avant attend the BET AWARDS '14 Debra Lee's Pre-Dinner held at Milk Studios on June 28, 2014 in Los Angeles, California.

A parolee who murdered 81-year-old philanthropist Jacqueline Avant, the wife of a legendary music executive, was sentenced Tuesday to 190 years in a California prison.

Aariel Maynor, 30, pleaded guilty to murder and other charges in Los Angeles Superior Court last month and admitted he used an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle to shoot Avant in her Beverly Hills home Dec. 1 and fired several rounds at her security guard as he fled.

Avant was married to Clarence Avant, a Grammy winner known as the “Godfather of Black Music” for mentoring and helping the careers of artists including Bill Withers, Little Willie John, L.A. Reid, Babyface, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.

Maynor shot Jacqueline Avant in the back when she surprised him after he broke into the couple’s house during a burglary attempt in which he hoped to steal $50,000, prosecutors said. After fleeing the scene, he broke into a home in the Hollywood Hills and then accidentally shot himself in the foot as he was leaving.

Avant used her money for charities that helped low-income neighborhoods such as Watts and South Los Angeles. She was on the board of the International Student Center at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Clarence Avant, 91, a concert promoter and manager, was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame last year.

Prosecutors said Maynor had searched for information on Clarence Avant and the couple’s address the day before the killing.

Maynor showed no remorse for the slaying, bragging to a friend on a jail phone call about all the news stories about him and laughing, according to a court document filed by Deputy District Attorney Victor Avila.

“You think my mama’s seen that?” he asked.

“I don’t know, but that’s not funny,” the woman, who was not identified, said. “Why are you laughin’? That’s somebody’s life. That’s somebody’s family member.”

The Avants were married for 54 years and had two children, Alexander Du Bois Avant and Nicole Avant, a film producer and former U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas who is married to Netflix co-CEO and Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos.

After Jacqueline Avant’s death, tributes were paid to her and her charitable work by former President Bill Clinton, Earvin “Magic” Johnson and Quincy Jones.

Maynor, who was on parole for his second robbery conviction, bragged to a friend during a jail call that he expected a shorter sentence because prosecutors were not seeking life without parole.

“I’m gonna get out of jail. I’ll probably do like 20 … 25, get out, you feel me?” he said.

Under District Attorney George Gascón, the office did not seek a special circumstance allegation that the killing was committed in the act of a burglary, which could have led to a possible sentence of life without parole.

Critic’s Notebook: ‘Rothaniel’ and Jerrod Carmichael’s Stunning Act of Faith,"The last time I prayed, it was awkward — a reflection, really, of my relationship with God.

I’m sure with everything going on, the Lord isn’t judging me for my extended hiatus. But on that evening many months ago, when I decided to kneel beside my bed, clasp my hands and shut my eyes, I sincerely wondered if God was mad at me.

I wanted to ease the tension between us, so, naturally, I started my prayer with a joke: a brief bit about my absence, the state of the world, my anxieties, existential malaise. And it worked. My body loosened. My words become more animated, my storytelling more energetic. Humor has a way of doing that — soothing nerves and clearing the way for a sometimes destabilizing level of honesty.

I thought about my conversation with God while watching Jerrod Carmichael’s Rothaniel, a stunning and unnerving act of storytelling. The hour-long special, which premiered on HBO in early April, has already been written about considerably, with critics observing how it pushes stand-up into the realm of confession and functions as group therapy, or focusing on Carmichael’s brilliant use of silences, his coming out as gay and his engagement with the live audience. These pieces have rightly folded Carmichael into a new class of introspective, intimate stand-up specials, which include Hannah Gadsby’s Nanette, Bo Burnham’s Inside and even Pete Davidson’s Alive from New York.

I agree with many of these readings. But watching Rothaniel for a second, and then third, time, I couldn’t shake the feeling that Carmichael was doing something more: that this comedian, who has already released two stand-up specials, a short-lived sitcom and a pair of brief personal documentaries — material in which he gestures at his sexuality, explores family secrets, confronts his parents and demonstrates a desire to build rapport with the audience — was trying to really push himself and viewers. Buoyed by the freedom found within humor, Rothaniel struck me as a delicate movement between different forms of storytelling — a work that begins as confessional comedy, is organized like a memoir and is finally imbued with and sustained by the ecstatic energy of prayer.

Carmichael is a man of faith, although, as he says in Rothaniel, coming out as gay has forced him to redefine what that means. Religion, the church and the Bible have, for the most part, always made appearances in his work. In Love at the Store, his first special, directed by Spike Lee, he jokes about Michael Jackson reaching the gates of heaven, presenting St. Peter and the Lord with a conundrum. They are fans of the star, but they are also the moral authorities: Can they let the King of Pop in amid the accusations against him? In 8, directed by Bo Burnham, who also directed Rothaniel, Carmichael presents an absence of faith, performing an extended bit about how he struggles to care and feel strongly about any issues. His family in The Carmichael Show was deeply religious and in his two documentaries, Home Videos and Sermon on the Mount, both directed by the comedian himself, he grapples with the tension between his mother’s faith, his father’s infidelity and his family’s penchant for keeping secrets.

In Rothaniel, Carmichael returns to the subject of secrets. He is older now, much more in command of himself. You can tell just by the smoothness with which he gets on stage, takes a seat and addresses the applauding crowd shadowed by the darkness of the Blue Note Jazz Club in New York. His performing and storytelling abilities are sharper, too, allowing him to achieve a new degree of candor.

Carmichael opens with a handful of jokes that show off his signature style of humor. These jabs about the number of affairs in his family history, about his grandmother being a “side-piece,” about the embarrassment around his real name get the crowd going, but they are also a warm-up, allowing Carmichael to ease himself into the space and the crowd. In a recent talk for the New York Public Library, the critic and memoirist Margo Jefferson, whom Carmichael reminds me of, observed how humor factored into her own work. It allowed her to “break through my decorum, my anxiety,” she said, which led her to “other tones, to acknowledge a sort of grief, a sort of self-abnegation.”

Humor serves a similar function in Rothaniel. It allows Carmichael to access a more honest register in this story he has decided to share. In his previous work and in interviews about the special, the comedian has hinted at the suffocating role decorum and politesse play in his family, how they poison conversations and attempts to bridge gaps of understanding. As Carmichael moves from historical affairs to the present, his special transcends the introspective comedy of late and enters the realm of memoir. The contours of the narrative become clearer: This is a story about how revealing another person’s secrets (specifically, telling his mother about his father’s cheating) forced Carmichael to confess his own, and how that admission did not lead to immediate catharsis.

When he comes out, his silences serve as interludes, marking a shift in the story. Carmichael never abandons the humor, but he does lower the volume. The audience becomes louder as they chime in with prompting questions and affirmative statements of love and support. But when Carmichael starts talking about his mother, a central character in many of his stories, I couldn’t help but feel as though he is speaking to someone beyond the people in the audience and viewers at home. The perspective changes, too. Carmichael’s face occupies the left edge of the frame; when he shakes his head in disbelief at his mother’s responses to him, he looks up, away, elsewhere.

Rothaniel, then, starts to feel like a searching prayer, a conversation with God after a long hiatus. Carmichael starts and then abandons thoughts about his mother. He recalls how she told him, in a previous conversation about being gay, that she “can’t go against Jesus.” He follows that by saying he understands that she is trying her best. Prayer isn’t always about request or gratitude. Much like journaling or therapy or talking to a friend, it can help you make sense of the world.

The latter half of Carmichael’s special plays like a communion, a spiritual meeting between him, his family’s past and the unknown terrain of their future. Sitting on the stage, the comedian wears a loneliness familiar to anyone whose survival and self-preservation are at odds with the narratives maintained by their loved ones. To share that experience — with all the relief, confusion and discomfort that come with it — and to trust that those watching will follow is, to me, an extraordinary act of faith.",Lovia Gyarkye,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-reviews/critics-notebook-jerrod-carmichael-rothaniel-hbo-1235132121/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/JCS_FPP_111T_F_v2-H-2022.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter,"The last time I prayed, it was awkward — a reflection, really, of my relationship with God.

‘The Goldbergs’ Renewed for Season 10 at ABC,"The Goldbergs is making it to the decade mark.

The 1980s-set comedy has been renewed for its 10th season on ABC. The renewal arrives a month after star and exec producer Wendi McLendon-Covey signed a new deal to return with producers Sony Pictures Television. The pact, which sources note includes an option for an 11th season, included a sizable pay bump.

With the pickup, The Goldbergs becomes part of an increasingly exclusive club of live-action broadcast comedies to have run for a decade or more. That list includes Friends, Married … With Children, The Jeffersons, Cheers, Frasier (which is also returning with a Paramount+ revival), M*A*S*H, Modern Family, Two and a Half Men, The Big Bang Theory and Will & Grace (with that tally including its NBC revival).

Before McLendon-Covey’s new deal, The Goldbergs was strongly on the bubble despite its ranking as the longest-running live-action comedy currently airing on broadcast. The show has had a challenging ninth season and had to write in the death of George Segal (who played the beloved Pops) and is currently working around the departure of star Jeff Garlin.

Garlin, who played patriarch Murray Goldberg, exited in December following an HR investigation that stemmed from multiple complaints over his behavior on the set of the comedy. Sources at the time described the decision as a mutual one between Garlin and Sony. At the time, he was not expected to return for the potential and now-confirmed 10th season.

The Goldbergs had been relatively free of controversy during its run. The series weathered sexual misconduct allegations around former recurring player Bryan Callen, who toplined ABC/Sony’s short-lived 1990s-set spinoff, Schooled. Callen has not appeared on The Goldbergs since the allegations came out in a July 2020 Los Angeles Times report. (Callen denied the allegations.)

The Goldbergs is a semiautobiographical comedy based on the childhood of series creator Adam F. Goldberg. Goldberg served as showrunner until season seven, when he moved his overall deal from Sony to Disney. Alex Barnow and Chris Bishop — who have been with series since its debut — have helmed the show since then and exec produce alongside Doug Robinson and star McLendon-Covey, among others. The cast also includes Sean Giambrone, Troy Gentile, Hayley Orrantia and Sam Lerner.

The Goldbergs joins a roster of returning scripted fare on ABC’s 2022-23 schedule that also includes dramas The Good Doctor, Grey’s Anatomy, The Rookie, Station 19 and comedy breakout Abbott Elementary.

‘Gaslit’ Showrunner on How the Series Explores “Complicity and Why People Do Horrible Things”,"Sean Penn, Julia Roberts, Dan Stevens and Betty Gilpin attend the ""Gaslit"" New York Premiere at Metropolitan Museum of Art on April 18, 2022 in New York City.

New York City’s Metropolitan Museum of Art was transformed into the red — or, rather, yellow — carpet on Monday for the world premiere of Starz’s upcoming political thriller Gaslit, starring Julia Roberts and Sean Penn.

The series — which also features Dan Stevens and Betty Gilpin — is described as a modern take on Watergate that focuses on the untold stories and forgotten characters of the scandal and centers on Martha Mitchell (Roberts), an Arkansan socialite and wife to John Mitchell (Penn), Richard Nixon’s attorney general. Martha was the first to publicly sound the alarm on the former president’s involvement in the Watergate scandal, which caused his presidency and her personal life to unravel.

Showrunner Robbie Pickering said his interest in Nixon and Watergate began when he was a child, and he saw his mom crying while watching his funeral on TV.

“She said, ‘He was a good man. He was a great man. He was misunderstood. And the liberals did this to him,” Pickering told The Hollywood Reporter. “I was like, ‘I’ve got to know everything about this guy.’ And I started learning about the people around him and this weird culture around him of complicity and cultural bitterness, which we still have today.”

The creator said he took inspiration from the worst qualities of himself and the people he knows and wrote them into the fictionalized version of Gaslit‘s real-life characters.

“The show really explores complicity and why people do horrible things,” he said. “One of the reasons is ambition. So, John Dean (Stevens) is just me writing myself as a young person in Hollywood, writing terrible scripts to impress somebody. John Mitchell, who’s Sean Penn’s character, just feels valued by Nixon. He feels valued by somebody in power, and I think we all know what that’s like to feel — it’s just this weird, seductive feeling.”

Despite the many flaws of the series’ characters, Pickering said creating a show from their perspective gives him hope because it humanized the “pathetic idiots” a bit, adding that some people are prone to be complicit in things that go against who they are.

“It gives me hope because the flip side of that is no matter how flawed we think we are, we all have the capacity to speak up and speak the truth and be heroic,” he says. “Martha was a very flawed person, so really going into her story, it gives you hope for as long as we have villains… as long as we have Putins, we’ll have Zelenskys.”

Because Gaslit is based on actual events and real people, the cast was able to deep dive into researching their onscreen counterparts — who they were, why they did the things they did and how they got to that point in their lives.

“I read Mo Dean’s book, A Woman’s View of Watergate, and I watched hours of the Watergate hearings, where she’s supporting her husband,” said Betty Gilpin, who portrays Maureen “Mo” Dean, wife of Nixon’s White House Counsel John Dean. “There’s so much going on behind her eyes, she’s such an enigma.”

Stevens also used the Watergate hearings to prepare for his role, which piqued his interest because it was “such a key moment” in history and “such an interesting story.”

“There’s a lot of footage of John Dean, sitting, droning on during the hearings, and he’s wheeled out on CNN pretty regularly as their resident corruption expert,” Stevens said.

Gilpin and Stevens star alongside Roberts and Penn, who take on the lead roles in Gaslit. The A-listers wanted to work together for years before finally getting the chance to in the Starz series, Pickering said, adding, “There’s this very deep love between them.”

https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-feature-shoot-days-decline-but-overall-filming-hits-record-1235132041/,"First-quarter filming in Los Angeles set a new record to start the year despite an escalating slide in feature film production.

Local film office FilmLA attributed the drop-off to productions being lured by more attractive tax incentives in other jurisdictions and a shortage of soundstage space in the area. According to a new report issued on Tuesday, feature film shoots saw a 25 percent dip below the five year average in the first quarter of 2022.

“It’s doing really well worldwide, but we’ve lost our share of it for years now,” FilmLA president Paul Audley tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Although the pace of production has slowed compared to the end of last year, output is much higher so far than it was in the same period in 2021 when the spread of the Delta variant led to a voluntary filming hiatus that slowed production to just 7,011 shoot days. FilmLA reported that the first quarter of 2022 was the busiest first quarter ever, with 9,832 shoot days. The last time there was such high filming levels from January through March was in 2016.

TV filming, especially drama and reality shows, drove the surge, the film office said. TV production is up 18.7 percent over the same period last year.

But shooting for feature films continued on a steady downward trajectory, according to the report. Despite a slight uptick in production compared to last year, the category remains 25.2 percent below its five year average (FilmLA’s five year averages exclude 2020 when production was suspended in Los Angeles from March to June because of COVID-19).

Productions have turned to shooting outside of California to take advantage of more generous tax incentives. Georgia, for example, offers a 30 percent tax credit with no annual cap on its program. The credit is also transferable, meaning projects can sell it to companies that owe taxes. California remains one of just two states whose credits are largely nontransferable and nonrefundable.

The perception that California’s tax credits are less competitive than other states combined with a shortage of soundstage space in Los Angeles has led to the decline in feature film production, Audley observed. He said, “If you need to shoot a feature that needs six, seven, eight stages, it’s impossible to do that now.”

In July, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill (SB144) meant to tackle the soundstage shortfall. It includes a new $150 million credit to incentivize the construction of sets.

Locally filmed projects include Netflix’s Me Time, Home Delivery, Love Me to Death and Rooming with Danger.

Television has become a mainstay of production in Los Angeles, filling the gap that the flight of feature film shoots have left. Audley said the first quarter filming record is at least partially a result of a backlog of productions that pivoted to shooting locally after realizing that going elsewhere would be more costly and troublesome because of COVID-19 restrictions.

“As the COVID era continued, a lot of productions couldn’t leave their base,” Audley said. “They’d have to quarantine for two weeks if they went to other parts of the country. Those productions ended up staying here in LA.”

Production for HBO’s The Flight Attendant moved from New York to Los Angeles in 2021.

FilmLA reported that filming for episodic dramas saw a 8.6 percent increase over the five-year average, owing to a significant demand for content on streaming platforms. TV dramas that filmed locally include FX’s American Horror Stories, Apple TV+’s Little America, HBO’s Perry Mason, ABC’s Promised Land and CBS’ S.W.A.T.

Tax incentives are a significant driver of local TV dramas choosing to shoot in Los Angeles. Shows receiving tax credits generated 499 shoot days for the quarter, representing 39 percent of all activity in the category.

California bolstered in July the Film & Television Tax Credit program with an additional $180 million in incentives on top of the $330 million already earmarked for the industry. Part of the program is geared specifically toward incentivizing TV productions to relocate to California.

As in recent quarters, TV reality production continued to significantly escalate. Filming for the category increased 71.7 percent, with 2,600 shoot days to start the year. Projects that filmed locally include Basketball Wives, Celebrity IOU, Family or Fiancé and People Magazine Investigates.

“Seeing cycles in production for all of these [categories] is not unusual,” Audley said. “The explosion of reality tv has to do with covid era where they could do those productions with not a lot of cast and crew and not have a lot of issues.”",Winston Cho,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/los-angeles-feature-shoot-days-decline-but-overall-filming-hits-record-1235132041/,https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/gettyimages-1218653953.jpg?w=1024,HollywoodReporter,"First-quarter filming in Los Angeles set a new record to start the year despite an escalating slide in feature film production.

‘Better Call Saul’ Star Michael Mando on the Dangerous Road Ahead for Ignacio,"[The following interview contains spoilers for Better Call Saul’s two-episode premiere.]

The walls are closing in on Michael Mando’s Ignacio “Nacho” Varga.

In the long awaited final season premiere of Better Call Saul, Ignacio, the reluctant lieutenant to the Salamanca’s drug-dealing operation, narrowly escaped a standoff with the Salamanca cousins (Daniel and Luis Moncada), as Gus Fring (Giancarlo Esposito) set him up to be the fall guy for the massacre at Lalo Salamanca’s (Tony Dalton) compound. Die-hard fans of the Breaking Bad universe have speculated about this storyline since it was first teased nearly 13 years ago during Saul Goodman’s Breaking Bad introduction, “Better Call Saul.”

With the Salamancas still hot on his heels, Mando makes it clear that Ignacio’s quest to protect himself and his father becomes even more formidable.

“As the story progresses, we’ll get to see what he’s really made of and how far he’s willing to go to protect his father,” Mando tells The Hollywood Reporter.

Towards the end of the Vince Gilligan-helmed second episode, Ignacio made a last-ditch call for help to Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks), Fring’s fixer. The two have shared a bond since Mike first helped Ignacio with his ever-increasing Salamanca problem in Better Call Saul season two’s “Gloves Off.”

“There’s this unspoken virtue between them and an honor among thieves. They respect innocent lives, which the Salamancas don’t. They honor their word, which the Salamancas don’t. And Gus doesn’t either,” Mando says.

In a recent conversation with THR, Mando also recalls a moment on set with Gilligan where they both took turns bashing a wall-mounted air conditioning unit.

On April 26th, 2009, Breaking Bad viewers first heard the name Ignacio as Saul Goodman (Bob Odenkirk) blamed him for something he presumably did to Lalo (Tony Dalton). And now, nearly 13 years later, we’re finally seeing that fabled story unfold. How rewarding has this climactic moment been for you?

It’s been unbelievable. I don’t know what I’ve done to be so lucky. You can work really hard and have a lot of talent, but for the stars to align the way they have in my career, it fills me up with a sense of tremendous gratitude, humility and responsibility.

There are numerous parallels between Ignacio and Jesse Pinkman (Aaron Paul), and the Vince Gilligan-directed episode two, “Carrot and Stick,” helps make these first few episodes of Better Call Saul feel like Ignacio’s version of Jesse’s story in El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie. So what do you make of Ignacio’s own attempt to do right in the end and hopefully free himself?

To play a character who’s breaking good when the full current of the scripts are breaking bad, it positions you with tremendous pressure, but it’s so rewarding despite the pain, frustration and torment of the character. Because deep down, at its core, you know you’re doing the right thing. You’re standing up for virtue, and in a show about morality, you’re one of the only characters, if not the only character, who’s really going from dark to light. So it’s such a heroic and fulfilling place to be, and I feel very grateful that they’ve given me that responsibility.

Ignacio is running for his life in these early episodes, and it looks especially painful since he’s wearing boots in the process. Did you take on most of that work?

(Laughs.) I did every stunt in all those episodes except for two: the jumping out of the building and the moment of collision with the trucks. Other than that, I did everything else myself. And it was just an incredible order that they’ve asked me to deliver this season. First of all, it’s incredibly physical. It’s excruciatingly emotional, and psychologically, you’re just hitting every note on the piano. It was just such an amazing rollercoaster ride.

Your shoulder was really leaning into that air conditioning unit.

Absolutely! At one point, Vince yelled, “Cut!” and then he came out and started doing it himself. So it was awesome.

What do you remember about filming the shootout and standoff with Don Eladio’s (Steven Bauer) sicarios and the Salamanca cousins?

I remember learning a tremendous amount from Vince. He thinks in cinematic moments. He is diligent with homework, but he’s also really quick to improvise. In some of the crucial moments in that epic stakeout, he had me play them in almost two completely opposite ways, and he would adjust storytelling elements very slightly as we went along. So it was wonderful to learn from a master. That whole motel sequence was shot on two locations. We shot at the actual parking lot of the motel, but all the interior scenes were shot in the studio.

Ignacio was quite antsy in that motel room. He could sense that something wasn’t right before he figured it out definitively. What notes were you given during that sequence?

Vince said two things about Nacho that stuck with me. He said, “This is a samurai without a master.” Like a rōnin. And he also said that he’s a tiger in a cage or a lion in a cage. I can’t remember which of the two it was. (Laughs.) But I think that was a really good stepping stone for me to get into the mindset of this character. I knew that Vince wanted to pan in that [motel room] shot, and so I asked him why. And his answer is why Vince is such a genius. He said frankly, “They built a wonderful set, and I want to show it.” And that, to me, is the magic of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul. Every department gets its rightful due. We’re all working on this together, and that was such a beautiful thing to hear and to learn.

Ignacio doesn’t know that Mike is sticking his neck out for him and his father. He also doesn’t know that Mike is doing it in part to prevent another father and son ending up like him and his murdered son, Matty. Does Ignacio sense that Mike was a father? Is that why he issued this cry for help in the first place?

There’s a profound connection between Mike and Nacho that is sort of unspoken. In many ways, they are cut from the same cloth, and Nacho looks at Mike as a mirror of his own father in the cartel world. There’s this unspoken virtue between them and an honor among thieves. They respect innocent lives, which the Salamancas don’t. They honor their word, which the Salamancas don’t. And Gus doesn’t either. So there’s definitely a profound, subtextual connection between the two, and maybe in the subconscious of it all, there’s a feeling that there’s a situation between Mike and Nacho. When Mike sent Tuco [Raymond Cruz] to jail, Nacho had a profound sadness to see Mike being beaten up like that. He really cared for him and asked him, “Why are you punishing yourself for people who would kill and have killed innocent people without even thinking about it?”

When he’s alone with his thoughts, does Ignacio ever regret going after Tuco? Things have spiraled ever since as Hector (Mark Margolis), Gus (Giancarlo Esposito) and Lalo (Tony Dalton) entered into his orbit.

He had no choice with Tuco. He started doing a lot of meth again, and that’s when he kills people for no logical reason. So Nacho was immediately put in a predicament where these guys weren’t going to let him walk. And so he had no choice because he knew that Tuco was going to end up killing him one way or another. In season two, Nacho made that really clear to Mike when he explained the situation with Dog Paulson. Tuco shot this guy’s head off, and he almost killed Ignacio doing it. Pieces of this guy’s skull are still lodged in Ignacio’s chest. So it’s a tragic story about a man who gets caught up at a young age with the wrong crowd, and because of his abilities, they won’t let him go. He becomes too valuable.

What can you say about the dangerous road ahead as Ignacio fights for his life and the life of his father (Juan Carlos Cantu)?

These characters are iconic, and each character represents something. I think Ignacio is the prodigal son, and he represents redemption, sacrifice and love. So as the story progresses, we’ll get to see what he’s really made of and how far he’s willing to go to protect his father.

Russia sets new Mariupol ultimatum in 'Battle of Donbas' as West pledges more help,"Summary Russia tells Ukrainians at Mariupol plant to lay down arms

U.S., Britain, Canada, France and Germany promise more help

No sign of renewed peace talks - Ukrainian official

KYIV/KHARKIV, April 19 (Reuters) - Russia was intensifying its attack on Ukraine's east on Tuesday as it seized a frontline city and sought a decisive victory in Mariupol, prompting Western governments to pledge more arms and sanctions.

Thousands of Russian troops backed by artillery and rocket barrages were advancing in what Ukrainian officials called the Battle of the Donbas.

Russia's nearly eight-week-long invasion has taken longer than many expected while still failing to capture any of the biggest cities, forcing Moscow to refocus in and around separatist regions.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The biggest attack on a European state since 1945 has, however, seen nearly 5 million people flee abroad and reduced cities to rubble as the incursion drags on.

Russia was hitting the Azovstal steel plant, the main remaining stronghold in Mariupol, with bunker-buster bombs, a Ukrainian presidential adviser said late on Tuesday. Reuters could not verify the details.

""The world watches the murder of children online and remains silent,"" adviser Mykhailo Podolyak wrote on Twitter.

After an earlier ultimatum to surrender lapsed and as midnight approached, Russia's defence ministry said not a single Ukrainian soldier had laid down their weapons and renewed the proposal. Ukrainian commanders at Azovstal have vowed not to surrender.

""Russia's armed forces, based purely on humanitarian principles, again propose that the fighters of nationalist battalions and foreign mercenaries cease their military operations from 1400 Moscow time on 20th April and lay down arms,"" the Russian Defence Ministry said.

The United States, Canada, Britain, France and Germany pledged more support to Ukraine.

""We will continue to provide them more ammunition, as we will provide them more military assistance,"" White House spokesperson Jen Psaki said, adding that new sanctions were being prepared.

""It is unfair that Ukraine still has to ask for (weapons) which have been sitting for years in the storage depots of our partners"" President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said in a video address.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a four-day humanitarian pause in the fighting this coming weekend, when Orthodox Christians celebrate Easter, to allow civilians to escape and humanitarian aid to be delivered.

Russia says it launched what it calls a ""special military operation"" on Feb. 24 to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Kyiv and its Western allies reject that as a false pretext.

CITY CAPTURED

Ukraine said the new assault had resulted in the capture of Kreminna, an administrative centre of 18,000 people in Luhansk, one of the two Donbas provinces.

Russian forces were attacking ""on all sides"", authorities were trying to evacuate civilians and it was impossible to tally the civilian dead, Luhansk regional governor Serhiy Gaidai said.

In Moscow, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov confirmed that ""another stage of this operation is beginning"".

Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu said Russia was ""methodically"" carrying out its plan to ""liberate"" Donetsk and Luhansk, provinces which Moscow demands Kyiv cede fully to Russian-backed separatists.

Driven back by Ukrainian forces in March from an assault on Kyiv in the north, Russia has instead poured troops into the east for the Donbas offensive. It has also made long-distance strikes at other targets including the capital.

Ukraine's top security official, Oleksiy Danilov, said Russian forces had tried to break through Ukrainian defences ""along almost the entire front line of Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv regions"".

The coal- and steel-producing Donbas has been the focal point of Russia's campaign to destabilise Ukraine since 2014, when the Kremlin used proxies to set up separatist ""people's republics"" in parts of Luhansk and Donetsk provinces.

Moscow now says its aim is to capture the full provinces on the separatists' behalf. Ukraine has a large force defending northern parts of the Donbas and military experts say Russia aims to cut them off or surround them.

But Russia still needs to keep its troops supplied across miles of hostile territory. Ukraine has counter-attacked near Kharkiv in the rear of Russia's advance, apparently aiming to cut off supply lines.

SHELL-SHOCKED RESIDENTS

In Mariupol, scene of the war's heaviest fighting and worst humanitarian catastrophe, about 120 civilians living next to the sprawling steel plant left via humanitarian corridors, the Interfax news agency reported on Tuesday, quoting Russian state TV.

Mariupol has been besieged since the war's early days. Tens of thousands of residents have been trapped with no access to food or water and bodies litter the streets. Ukraine believes more than 20,000 civilians have died there.

Russia has denied targeting civilians in its invasion of Ukraine and says, without evidence, that signs of atrocities were staged.

Capturing Mariupol would link pro-Russian separatist territory with the Crimea region that Moscow annexed in 2014.

In Russian-held districts reached by Reuters, shell-shocked residents cooked on open fires outside their damaged homes.

""Obviously, against the backdrop of the Mariupol tragedy, the negotiation process has become even more complicated,"" Podolyak told Reuters.

Kyiv and Moscow have not held face-to-face talks since March 29. Each side blames the other for their breakdown.

""It is difficult to say when the next face-to-face round of negotiations will be possible because the Russians are seriously betting on the so-called 'second stage of the special operation',"" Podolyak said.

Shells and rockets also hit Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, local officials said, wrecking apartment blocks and other buildings. Four people were killed and 14 wounded, they said.

Reuters journalists saw the bodies of three people apparently killed by shrapnel lying on the pavement.

Summary Some civilians say they had no choice but to flee to Russia

Ukraine human rights ombudswoman says 33,000 forcibly deported

Ukrainians often sent deep into Russia, far from border

Moscow says it is providing humanitarian aid

KYIV, April 19 (Reuters) - Mila Panchenko found herself on a station platform in southwest Russia after lack of food and water forced her to hand herself over to pro-Russian forces to escape the besieged Ukrainian city of Mariupol.

At the station in Taganrog, a port on the Sea of Azov, she was put on a train along with around 200 other Ukrainians and told they were being transported to another part of Russia's Rostov region, which borders Ukraine.

But when the train arrived at its destination, the 53-year-old found herself in Tula province in central Russia, in the town of Suvorov, some 1,000 km (621 miles) away.

""There were a lot of police. The station was sealed off so no Russian civilians could approach us,"" Panchenko said, adding that there were crowds to greet them but the son of a friend from Tula - who she did not identify - was not allowed in. ""We were met cheerfully, with cookies.""

In addition to Panchenko, Reuters spoke to another Ukrainian woman - Natalia Bil-Maer - who escaped Mariupol last month, as well as the relatives of two other refugees.

They painted a picture of some civilians in Mariupol having no choice but to flee from the besieged city to Russia, a journey that involved repeated searches and questioning by pro-Russian forces before being transported often far from Ukraine's border.

Reuters was unable to verify their stories independently.

The Kremlin did not respond to a request for comment about the independent accounts provided to Reuters by Panchenko and Bil-Maer of Ukrainians being sent to distant parts of Russia without any choice.

Moscow has denied intentionally targeting civilians since invading Ukraine on Feb. 24.

Panchenko said she and the other Ukrainians on the train were taken by Russian authorities to a sanatorium in the Tula region called Krainka. She was given a room with a small fridge, a television and two single beds. Laid on a table was traditional gingerbread, sweet biscuits, water and iced tea.

The Krainka resort did not respond to a request for comment on its role in sheltering the Ukrainians.

After arriving at the sanatorium, Panchenko - the duty manager of a cistern factory before the war and a member of the local council - said she was fingerprinted, photographed and questioned in front of a prosecutor, whom Reuters was unable to identify.

Panchenko - who speaks Russian and Ukrainian - was asked whether the suppression of the Russian language in Ukraine had worsened since 2014, she said.

In that year, Russia annexed the Crimea peninsula while two breakaway regions of Ukraine -- Donetsk and Luhansk -- declared themselves people's republics with Moscow's backing.

One of Russia's justifications for what it calls its ""special military operation"" in Ukraine is to protect Russian speakers from what Moscow brands aggression from Ukrainian nationalists. Ukraine has denied this.

""I only said that I could speak Ukrainian and that I loved it ... I said I hadn't witnessed any suppression of Russian.""

FORCED DEPORTATIONS

Liudmyla Denisova, Ukraine's ombudswoman for human rights, said last week that Russia had taken 134,000 people from Mariupol and that 33,000 of those were forcibly deported. Reuters was unable to determine the accuracy of those statistics.

Rachel Denber, deputy director for Europe and Central Asia at Human Rights Watch, said her organisation had documented at least one instance where there was ""no question that it would be considered a forced transfer"" - which she defined as ""being forced to go to the side that has invaded your country.""

The 1949 Geneva Conventions, which defined legal standards for humanitarian treatment in conflict, prohibit the mass forcible transfer of civilians during an international conflict to the territory of the occupying power, classifying it as a war crime.

Russia says it is offering humanitarian aid to those wanting to leave Mariupol. A Russian government resolution, published on March 12 on its website, listed the whereabouts of 95,909 people across Russia who had left Ukraine and the two breakaway republics.

A month later, on April 14, Russian Colonel-General Mikhail Mizintsev said that 138,014 civilians had been rescued by Russian forces just from Mariupol, as the fighting intensified.

Panchenko said she fled Mariupol on March 17 when Chechen troops seized the building on the left bank of the Kalmius river where she and dozens of other civilians had been sheltering in a basement.

""They said that we had to evacuate because they wanted to set up their headquarters there,"" Panchenko said by telephone from Brescia, in northern Italy, where she is now living, having left Russia.

With scant supplies of food and water, Panchenko said she had no choice but to get into the cars offered by the Chechen soldiers to take them to Russian-controlled parts of Donetsk.

They were transported by car and then bus to the village of Bezimenne, where police from the separatist Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) have set up processing facilities, Panchenko said. They were fingerprinted and questioned by separatist police.

Spokespeople for the DPR and the Chechen authorities did not respond to a request for comment.

""We were asked if we had any connection with the Ukrainian Armed Forces, if we knew anyone from the Azov Battalion,"" she said, referring to a Ukrainian National Guard unit that Moscow has accused of targeting Russian speakers. ""We weren't on any lists, so they put us on a bus again and took us to Taganrog train station.""

TRAINS SENT ACROSS RUSSIA

On March 22, Bil-Maer fled the basement of a relative's apartment block with her husband and two children - aged 6 and 7 - as the Russian assault drew closer. They had planned to go to the nearby coastal town of Berdiansk, to the west, but their route was blocked by shelling.

""We had only one way left to go because that part of town was controlled by Russian soldiers ... So they transported us and we were deported to Russia.""

As they were taken through Russian-controlled territory, Bil-Maer said Ukrainians were repeatedly questioned and men were asked to strip, as Russian forces searched for combatants.

But by March 23 she found herself on Russian soil and was taken to Taganrog station.

""In Taganrog, there were a lot of nice words said to us: “We've saved you. We'll feed you”,"" said Bil-Maer, who saw trains headed to Tambov and Vladimir in central Russia. ""It was clear that every train was going to a different place.""

As soon as Bil-Maer could use her phone, she called an aunt in Russia's Krasnodar region, across the Sea of Azov from east Ukraine, and she came to pick up the family.

But, once in her aunt’s home, Bil-Maer said she was reluctant to go outside because she was tired of being told by strangers that the Russian bombing was Ukraine's fault for attacking Russian-speakers. She said many Russians echoed the Kremlin’s position - reproduced in the media - that civilian casualties in the conflict were caused by Ukraine’s own armed forces to discredit Moscow.

Bil-Maer quickly fled to Georgia with her husband and children.

She does not know how she will return home: she is struggling to get help from the Ukrainian embassy and only has her internal passport with her. Her husband also left the country with her illegally when it was banned because he was of fighting age.

Ukraine foreign ministry spokesman Oleg Nikolenko said Ukraine had to close its diplomatic missions in Russia for security reasons but embassies in the neighboring countries would provide consular assistance to Ukrainians deported to Russia to enable them to return home, including temporary travel documents.

After 10 days at the Krainka resort, Panchenko said she persuaded the Russians to allow her to leave for Nizhny Novgorod, a city on the Volga river east of Moscow, to stay with the family of an elderly neighbor from Mariupol who had fled with her.

Once outside the resort, Panchenko and her neighbor, who she identified as Zhan, went instead to Moscow and then to the Baltic States. Panchenko found her way eventually to Italy.

""But my plan is to make some money and return to my home Mariupol, if it stays Ukrainian,"" she said. ""I want to come back to Ukraine very much.""

DYMER, Ukraine, April 19 (Reuters) - Volodymyr Khropun and Yulia Ivannikova-Katsemon say they were helping people flee villages on the front line in northern Ukraine when they were detained by Russian soldiers over two days in March.

Both said they were then held with around 40 other captives on the concrete floor of a nearby factory, their hands bound. Nearly a week later they were transferred in a military truck to Belarus, and on to detention centres in Russia, they said.

Khropun, an electrical engineer, and Ivannikova-Katsemon, an emergency services dispatcher, were freed with 24 others in a prisoner exchange on April 9.

Standing outside the dank windowless room where they say they were kept in the formerly occupied village of Dymer, north of the capital, Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon have returned to describe their three weeks in Russian custody, which they said included being beaten. Ivannikova-Katsemon also said she was tasered.

Both said they were working as volunteers for the local Red Cross when they were taken prisoner, interrogated and accused of passing information on the activity of Russian forces to the other side, which they deny.

The Ukrainian Red Cross confirmed they were both volunteers. They were both reported as missing or illegally detained civilians by the Euromaidan SOS initiative of Ukrainian human rights group The Center for Civil Liberties as of March 26.

Reuters was not able to independently verify all the details of their stories. The Kremlin and Russia's defence ministry did not respond to requests for comment about their accounts.

Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon's detailed narratives shed more light on the mistreatment Ukraine alleges some of its citizens and soldiers have faced in Russian captivity since the start of the war. Their journey also shows one way Russia has transferred some of the hundreds of Ukrainian prisoners it says it holds to Russian territory.

Since the start of the war on Feb. 24, Ukraine and Russia have accused each other of violating the Geneva Conventions that cover the protection of civilians during war and the treatment of prisoners of war.

In March, Russia's human rights ombudswoman said she had heard about cases of ""cruel and inhuman treatment"" of Russian POWs in Ukraine.

This month Ukraine's human rights ombudswoman said returning POWs had described mistreatment while in Russian captivity that included being kept in basements, denied food and made to take off their clothes. read more

Authorities from both sides have repeatedly said they abide by international humanitarian law in terms of treatment of prisoners.

Speaking in the factory in Dymer, Khropun described what happened when he was first detained by Russian forces, after driving evacuees through a checkpoint on March 18.

""They arrested me, closed my eyes - as in, they pulled a hat over my eyes, bound it on with scotch tape - and then wrapped my hands in tape, like a terrorist. Then I was transferred here,"" said Khropun, 44.

He and Ivannikova-Katsemon had both been regularly crossing the front line to help locals escape the fighting around villages north of Kyiv. Ivannikova-Katsemon, 37, was detained similarly the next day, she said.

""There was always hope with God that I would return (home),"" said Ivannikova-Katsemon, who has children, occasionally pausing to steady her voice or hold back tears. ""The hard thing was not being able to tell family and friends that I was alive and in captivity.""

'NIGHTMARE COME TO LIFE'

The two said they were held in an unheated room at the small factory in Dymer, huddled on thin mattresses and scraps of cardboard. Around 40 detainees were crammed into the space, sharing a plastic pot for a toilet.

""It was like a nightmare come to life,"" Khropun said, speaking to Reuters back in the room where he was held.

He pointed to the dirty mattress he shared with several others. The floor was littered with trash, empty boxes of Russian army rations, zip ties and loops of tape that they said had bound people's hands.

Ivannikova-Katsemon described how she was able to slightly loosen the binding around her wrists with a safety pin that she kept hold of throughout her time in captivity by hiding it inside her hair tie.

The Russians brought food once or twice a day, mostly army crackers and the occasional pot of cooked food. There were only two plastic spoons so some people ate with their hands, others with scraps of paper, said Khropun.

One of the spoons was still jabbed into a pot that was half-full of what looked like rotting cabbage stew.

A bullet hole was visible in the concrete ceiling of the room. One of the guards had fired into the air to spook them, they said.

BELARUS AND RUSSIA

After nearly a week, Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon said that they and around 14 other detainees were loaded onto a military truck. They weren't told where they were going, but the stop-start journey through Belarus would eventually take them to official detention centres in Russia.

In Belarus, they said they were interrogated by the Russian military. They each received a document that included their photo, date of birth, height, hair colour and other identifying details that designated them as ""a person who has shown opposition to the special military operation"" - Russia's term for its war in Ukraine.

They showed Reuters copies of the documents, titled 'Certificate of Identity' and issued by the Russian armed forces.

""The first stage was being stripped naked, photographed, the noting of scars, I have a few. Then the pouring of water (on me) and a beating,"" Ivannikova-Katsemon said. The document she received lists her scars in a section called ""Other features"".

Once in Russia, the two said they passed through several different detention centres. At one point, Ivannikova-Katsemon said she was told she would be sent to work in a timber camp in Russia's far east.

""I don't know the place, they just said: Siberia,"" she recalled.

Khropun said he faced multiple interrogations in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, sometimes being forced to kneel for long periods in cold rooms or beaten on his knees or ribs.

He said younger prisoners were singled out for especially tough beatings by guards, who also shaved the captives' heads and beards, sometimes leaving a tuft or half a moustache as a form of humiliation.

He said he tried to keep up the morale of his fellow detainees, who he said were also Ukrainian civilians. ""I’d say, 'guys – we will all get home 100%. There is just one small question: when?'""

RETURN HOME

On April 8, the two said they were given back the clothes they were wearing when first detained, still dirty from the days spent on the factory floor.

In handcuffs, they were taken by plane to Crimea from where they were driven by truck to Ukraine-controlled territory on April 9.

They said they had been selected for a prisoner swap, but did not know why they were picked over others.

After around three weeks in captivity, they were home.

""Of course there was the sense of joy, but it was somehow hard to fully comprehend,"" said Khropun.

Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon said they were the only ones to be exchanged from the group of detainees who were sent from Dymer to Russia. They described their fears for the others they believe are still being held in Russia.

The Ukrainian authorities have confirmed that 26 prisoners were swapped with Russia on April 9, but have not named them all. The office of deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk, who is in charge of negotiating the swaps, did not respond to a request for comment about the release of Khropun and Ivannikova-Katsemon.

On April 11, Vereshchuk said in total some 1,700 Ukrainian soldiers and civilians were being held in Russia and by pro-Russian separatists in the east of the country. read more

Ukraine held around 600 Russian military prisoners of war and no civilians as of April 4, according to Vereshchuk.

Russia does not release exact figures, but in late March its human rights ombudswoman said there were more than 500 Ukrainian POWs in Russia.

Ivannikova-Katsemon said she wears a medical corset and takes medicine to manage the pain she feels as a result of her treatment in captivity.

""But these monsters, who supposedly call themselves liberators, did not break me,"" she said, standing in the spring sunshine outside the Dymer factory.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The leaders of the United States, Britain and Canada pledged on Tuesday to send more artillery weaponry to Ukraine in the face of an all-out Russian assault on that country's East.

U.S. President Joe Biden, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted after they and other allied leaders took part in a secure video call as the Russian invasion reached a new phase.

Biden is expected to announce in coming days another military aid package for Ukraine about the same size as the $800 million one announced last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

If the aid package is as large as expected, it would bring total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February to well over $3 billion. read more

Asked by reporters during a visit to New Hampshire if the United States would be sending more artillery to Ukraine, Biden replied yes.

In London, Johnson told lawmakers: ""This will become an artillery conflict, they need support with more artillery, that is what we will be giving them ... in addition to many other forms of support.""

Trudeau said Canada would be sending heavy artillery and promised to provide more details.

White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters on Air Force One the leaders reaffirmed their commitment to providing Ukraine security and economic and humanitarian assistance.

""We will continue to provide them more ammunition, as we will provide them more military assistance,"" Psaki said. She said the United States was preparing another round of sanctions to impose on Moscow.

In their 90-minute video call, Biden and the allies discussed their diplomatic engagements and coordinated efforts to further impose ""severe economic costs to hold Russia accountable,"" Psaki said.

They are to coordinate through the G7, the European Union and NATO, she said.

Russia seized its first town in eastern Ukraine as part of a fresh assault that Ukraine has described as the Battle of the Donbas aimed at taking two provinces. read more

The United States sees Russia carrying out a ""prelude"" to larger offensive operations in the eastern part of its neighboring country, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday. read more

Biden's video call from the White House Situation Room began at 9:57 a.m. EDT (1357 GMT) and ended at 11:21 a.m. EDT (1521 GMT), with Biden speaking from the White House Situation Room.

Others on the call included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg as well as the leaders of Italy, Japan and Poland.

A French presidential adviser said the allies had discussed how to provide security guarantees to Ukraine after the war if it is not part of NATO and its automatic defense mechanism known as Article 5.

""Our country is ready to provide security guarantees,"" the French official said. ""It would be military supplies so that it can deal with a new attack or, possibly, guarantees that would see us get involved if Ukraine is attacked in a way where we could assess how to assist it.""

These guarantees would look more like the defense clause the European Union currently has among its members, the French official said, rather than a defense mechanism similar to NATO's Article 5, which triggers automatic military support if a member is attacked.

Allies also discussed the need to persuade non-EU, non-G7 countries to treat the war in Ukraine as an issue that concerns world peace and not just Europe or the West, the French official said.

Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24 in what it called a special operation to degrade its southern neighbour’s military capabilities and root out people it called dangerous nationalists. Ukrainian forces have mounted stiff resistance and the West has imposed sweeping sanctions on Russia in an effort to force it to withdraw its forces.

Analysis: Twitter exploring a sale would make free speech an afterthought,"People holding mobile phones are silhouetted against a backdrop projected with the Twitter logo in this illustration picture taken September 27, 2013. REUTERS/Kacper Pempel/Illustration/File Photo

April 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc's (TWTR.N) board directors can lean on concerns about the fate of the social media platform under Elon Musk to rebuff him, but if they decide to explore a sale, price will override all other considerations, corporate governance experts said.

The San Francisco-based company received a $43 billion ""best and final"" offer from Musk last week, which it is still reviewing. Musk, the world's richest person and CEO of Tesla Inc (TSLA.O), has said he wants to make Twitter an ""arena for free speech,"" cheering Twitter's critics who complain about censorship and alarming those worried about hate speech and bullying. read more

Twitter's board is expected to reject Musk's bid as too low by April 28, when it is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings, people familiar with the matter have said. Even if Twitter's bankers declared the offer was fair, the company's board directors have wide latitude to reject it if they thought the platform was better off with its current content strategy, corporate governance lawyers and professors said. read more

This would change, however, if, Twitter's board decided to explore a sale, either because it received more offers or it decided to solicit acquisition bids, these experts said.

Corporate law in Delaware, where Twitter is incorporated, dictates that once a company launches a sale process, securing the most lucrative deal for shareholders becomes the overarching consideration. Board directors are not allowed to factor in what would happen to the company in their deliberations if existing shareholders will cash out.

""All these culture and discourse and democracy considerations fall by wayside because that’s not going to benefit shareholders anymore,"" said Ann Lipton, a professor at Tulane Law School.

Twitter and Musk spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

As it stands, board directors legally have wide discretion on how to handle Musk's bid because it was unsolicited. The directors can refuse to engage with Musk if they believe the company's content policies and culture better serve the long-term interests of its investors, said Brian Quinn, a professor at Boston College Law School.

""If they think Musk will turn Twitter into a free-speech hellscape, that is sufficient justification,"" Quinn said.

Whether Twitter will decide to explore a sale will likely hinge on whether it receives attractive and credible offers in the coming days.

Private equity firm Thoma Bravo LP contacted Twitter last week to express interest in putting together an offer that would challenge Musk, but there is no certainty that such a bid will materialize, sources told Reuters. Sources have also said that other buyout firms have since contacted Twitter to register their acquisition interest. read more

NO FOUNDER AROUND TO PROTECT IT

Unlike its peers Snap Inc (SNAP.N) and Facebook owner Meta Platforms Inc (FB.O), Twitter is not controlled by founders with supervoting shares who can shoot down a deal even if viable and lucrative offers are on the table. Twitter adopted a poison pill last week to prevent Musk, who has amassed a stake in the company of more than 9%, from raising his stake to more than 15% without negotiating a deal with its board. read more

Adding to its vulnerability, Twitter has not set up a structure governing the moderation of its platform that would survive under new ownership. It has not, for example, set up a formal process for an independent arbiter to review its decisions, though its users can appeal to the company if their account is locked or suspended.

Meta, on the other hand, has set up an external Oversight Board, which allows users to appeal Facebook's decisions to remove or leave up certain content. The Oversight Board’s decisions are binding.

Twitter could face backlash from some of its shareholders if it does not explore a sale, including from Musk, who has tweeted that he wants the company's shareholders to have a say irrespective of what its board thinks. Musk could challenge the board in the company's 2023 annual meeting of shareholders by putting forward his own slate of nominees, and, if successful, force the company to explore a sale.

Unless Twitter decides to explore a sale, it can continue to look out for the interests of stakeholders beyond shareholders, such as its users and employees, corporate governance experts say.

""You are explicitly allowed to point to non-shareholder constituencies as your rationale for wanting to beat back the takeover,"" said Eric Talley, a professor at Columbia Law School.

April 19 (Reuters) - Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) co-founder Jack Dorsey took aim at the social media company's board in a series of tweets late on Monday as it weighs Elon Musk's $43 billion takeover offer.

Dorsey, who is also a Twitter board member, added to the chatter on the micro-blogging platform last week when he said that Twitter's board has ""consistently been the dysfunction of the company.""

In response a tweet on Monday asking him why he did not ""do anything about it"" when he was the CEO of Twitter, Dorsey expressed frustration at his limited ability to speak freely.

""So much to say … but nothing that can be said,"" Dorsey tweeted.

Dorsey's tweets come after two weeks of upheaval at the social media company that started with Musk disclosing a 9.2% stake and then making a buyout offer. On Friday, the board adopted a ""poison pill"" to limit Musk's ability to raise his stake in the company. read more

""I really wish I could break through all the abstraction here and answer you but alas and woe,"" Dorsey tweeted in reply to another thread urging him to share his thoughts.

Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Musk has been vocal in his criticism of Twitter's strategies and its board. He tweeted on Monday that the salary of Twitter's board members would be $0 if his bid succeeds, resulting in $3 million being saved every year.

Other potential buyers, including private equity firm Thoma Bravo, are also considering buyout bids for Twitter, according to reports. read more

Dorsey continues to serve as the CEO of Square and holds a seat on Twitter's board. His term is due to expire in May at the company's upcoming annual meeting.

NEW YORK, April 18 (Reuters Breakingviews) - The best buyer for Twitter (TWTR.N) may be nobody. The social network on Friday enacted a “poison pill” read more , temporarily blocking Elon Musk’s $41 billion takeover bid, but putting it in play. As Twitter learned in 2016 when multiple suitors walked away, closing a deal can be harder.

Musk’s offer of $54.20 per share, which is non-binding and lacks financing, is easy for Twitter to dismiss. It also shows the steep financial hill buyers will have to climb. The Tesla (TSLA.O) boss would earn an unattractive return of about 1% on his investment by 2024, according to a Breakingviews analysis read more using estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Reducing the board’s salaries to zero, as Musk claimed in a tweet on Monday, barely changes that calculation. Besides, the board would probably demand a higher premium before recommending a deal.

Twitter’s meager cash flow makes it hard for financial buyers like Thoma Bravo to finance a takeover with lots of debt. Private equity investors could join forces with Musk, who owns more than 9% of the company. But that would mean playing junior partner to the entrepreneur, whose ideas for Twitter appear to include upending its advertising business.

Microsoft (MSFT.O), Meta Platforms (FB.O) or Alphabet (GOOGL.O) might see an opportunity to squeeze more advertising revenue out of Twitter’s community of devoted users. But regulators in America and Europe read more have made it clear they will oppose any deals that make technology giants even more powerful.

Salesforce.com (CRM.N) wanted to buy Twitter in 2016, when the social network was roughly half its current size, but abandoned the effort after its stock fell on the news. Shareholders in the $188 billion software group are unlikely to be more receptive now. Brand-conscious buyers, meanwhile, will be wary. Former Walt Disney (DIS.N) CEO Bob Iger said he walked away in 2016 because of the “nastiness” on Twitter’s platform. Attempts to reduce negativity and disinformation may please advertisers but put off users like Musk, who worry it restricts free speech.

Musk’s interest shows that a lack of obvious financial logic may not prevent a deal. A more likely outcome, however, might be a partial investment, perhaps by a private equity firm. Silver Lake in 2020 invested $1 billion in Twitter through a convertible note, helping to finance a share buyback to get activist Elliott Management onside. The company could use a similar deal to buy Musk out of his stake. It would be a reminder that Twitter’s habitat lacks natural predators.

PARIS, April 19 (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron's lead in voting intention polls widened on Tuesday but his prime minister said a Macron win in Sunday's presidential runoff vote was not guaranteed, as far-right challenger Marine Le Pen accused him of fear-mongering.

Three polls for the second-round runoff put Macron at the highest level since before the first round, with an average score of 55.83%, up more than a point from Friday and more than three points from an average of five polls before the first round.

Prime Minister Jean Castex, however, said it was too early to claim victory.

""The game is not done and dusted,"" Castex said on France Inter radio.

An Ipsos poll saw Macron winning 56.5% of the vote, up half a point from Friday and 3.5 points from April 8, two days before the vote in which Macron and Le Pen qualified for the second round.

Polls by Opinionway and Ifop, at 56% and 55% respectively, also showed Macron with his highest share of voting intentions since before the first-round vote on April 10.

Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told Europe 1 radio that Le Pen would ""hand France's sovereignty to Vladimir Putin and to Russia"" if she was elected.

Le Pen has in the past voiced admiration for the Russian president and says she would pull France out of NATO's integrated military command.

Le Maire said a Le Pen victory would mean the end of French sovereignty, an alliance with Putin, a lack of NATO protection and severed ties with Germany.

In a campaign clip, Le Pen accused Macron and his allies of frightening citizens into voting against her.

""Macron, aware of his sombre prospects of winning a second term, has turned to ... blackmail by fear. Fear is the president's only remaining argument,"" she said.

Centrist Macron and Le Pen are seeking to attract voters who backed far-left leader Jean Luc Melenchon, after he came third in the first round with about 22% of the vote.

Melenchon's party has not given any voting instructions for the runoff but Melenchon has called on his followers not to vote for Le Pen. read more

In his first televised interview since the first round, Melenchon reiterated the call.

""You will make a colossal mistake if you vote for Mrs Le Pen. I don't tell you to vote for Macron, search inside your heads what's best, but don't do this,"" he told BFM TV.

Melenchon added that he would now focus on the legislative election this summer in order to form a left-wing majority and become the country's Prime Minister.

""I call on the French to elect me Prime Minister,"" Melenchon said, adding that he would be prepared to work with both Macron and Le Pen as presidents and that he had no clear preference between the two.

The Prime Minister in France, who is appointed by the president, has to control a majority in the National Assembly.

According to an Elabe poll also published on Tuesday, 42% of Melenchon's voters are now ready to give their vote to Macron, up 7% from last week.

"Netflix rocked by subscriber loss, may offer cheaper ad-supported plans","The Netflix logo is seen on a TV remote controller in this illustration photo taken January 20, 2022. REUTERS/Dado Ruvic/Illustration

April 19 (Reuters) - Global streaming giant Netflix Inc (NFLX.O) on Tuesday reported losing subscribers for the first time in more than a decade and predicted more contraction in the second quarter, a rare miss for a company that has been a reliable growth engine for investors.

The company's stock plunged 23% in after-market trading, erasing $30 billion in market value.

Netflix lost 200,000 subscribers in its first quarter, falling well short of its forecast of adding 2.5 million subscribers. Its decision in early March to suspend service in Russia after it invaded Ukraine resulted in the loss of 700,000 members.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

The company's poor results pummeled other video streaming-related stocks, with Roku (ROKU.O) dropping over 6%, Walt Disney (DIS.N) falling 3% and Warner Bros Discovery (WBD.O) down 2%.

Netflix, which currently has 221.6 million subscribers, last reported a loss in customers in October 2011.

The company offered a gloomy prediction for the spring quarter, forecasting it would lose 2 million subscribers, despite the return of such hotly anticipated series as ""Stranger Things"" and ""Ozark"" and the debut of the film ""The Grey Man,"" starring Chris Evans and Ryan Gosling. Wall Street targeted 227 million for the second quarter, according to Refinitiv data.

First-quarter revenue grew 10% to $7.87 billion, slightly below Wall Street's forecasts of $7.93 billion. It reported per-share net earnings of $3.53, beating the Wall Street consensus of $2.89.

""The large number of households sharing accounts -- combined with competition, is creating revenue growth headwinds. The big COVID boost to streaming obscured the picture until recently,"" Netflix said, explaining the difficulties of signing up new customers.

In addition to the paying households, Netflix is being watched by an additional 100 million households that it said were sharing accounts, including 30 million in the United States and Canada. As penetration has increased, the number of shared accounts has become a bigger problem.

The world's dominant streaming service was expected to report slowing growth, amid intense competition from established rivals like Amazon.com (AMZN.O), traditional media companies such as the Walt Disney and the newly formed Warner Bros Discovery and cash-flush newcomers like Apple Inc (AAPL.O).

Streaming services spent $50 billion on new content last year, in a bid to attract or retain subscribers, according to researcher Ampere Analysis. That's a 50% increase from 2019, when many of the newer streaming services launched, signaling the quick escalation of the so-called ""streaming wars.""

Netflix noted that despite the intensifying competition, its share of TV viewing in the United States has held steady according to Nielsen, a mark of subscriber satisfaction and retention.

""We want to grow that share faster,"" the company said.

As growth slows in mature markets like the United States, Netflix is increasingly focused on other parts of the world and investing in local language content.

""While hundreds of millions of homes pay for Netflix, well over half of the world's broadband homes don't yet -- representing huge future growth potential,"" the company said in a statement.

Netflix has been able to increase subscription prices in the United States, the United Kingdom and Ireland, to fund content production and growth in other parts of the world, such as Asia, noted Wedbush analyst Michael Pachter. However, subscription prices in these growth markets are lower.

Benchmark analyst Matthew Harrigan warned that the uncertain global economy ""is apt to emerge as an albatross"" for member growth and Netflix's ability to continue raising prices as competition intensifies.

Streaming services are not the only form of entertainment vying for consumers' time. The latest Digital Media Trends survey from Deloitte, released in late March, revealed that Generation Z, those consumers ages 14 to 25, spend more time playing games than watching movies or television series at home, or even listening to music.

The majority of Gen Z and Millennial consumers polled said they spend more time watching user-created videos like those on TikTok and YouTube than watching films or shows on a streaming service.

Netflix, recognizing the shift in consumer entertainment habits, has begun to invest in gaming, but it does not yet contribute materially to the company's revenue.

MEXICO CITY, April 19 (Reuters) - Mexico has disbanded a select anti-narcotics unit that for a quarter of a century worked hand-in-hand with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to tackle organized crime, two sources said, in a major blow to bilateral security cooperation.

The group was one of the Sensitive Investigative Units (SIU) operating in about 15 countries which U.S. officials tout as invaluable in dismantling powerful smuggling rings and busting countless drug lords around the globe. The units are trained by the DEA but under the control of national governments.

In Mexico, the over 50 officers in the SIU police unit were considered many of the country's best and worked on the biggest cases such as the 2016 capture of Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman, then the boss of the powerful Sinaloa cartel.

The closure threatens to imperil U.S. efforts to combat organized crime groups inside Mexico, one of the epicenters of the multi-billion dollar global narcotics trade, and make it harder to catch and prosecute cartel leaders.

President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador's government formally notified the DEA in April last year that the unit had been shut down, according to a DEA agent with knowledge of the matter who declined to be named as they were not authorized to speak about the issue. A second source familiar with the situation confirmed the closure of the unit.

Mexico's Public Security Ministry did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The DEA declined to comment. The closure of the unit was not reported before. Reuters was unable to find out why the Mexican government did not announce it publicly at the time.

""They strangled it,"" the agent said, referring to the unit. ""It shatters the bridges we spent decades putting together.""

The closure could prove costly on U.S. streets, where authorities are battling to reduce a surge in overdoses that last year led to more than 100,000 deaths mostly linked to a new wave of synthetic drugs produced by Mexican cartels.

The elite team, founded in 1997, was the main conduit for the DEA to share leads on drugs shipments and tips obtained on U.S. soil with Mexico's government.

The DEA would fly new Mexican entrants to its state-of-the-art facility in Quantico, Virginia, to train them on latest surveillance and policing techniques. U.S. officials also vetted them, including with polygraph tests.

A second Mexican SIU unit, based inside the Attorney General's Office and independent of Lopez Obrador's government, continues to operate.

For Mike Vigil, the DEA's former chief of international operations, the SIU closure and Lopez Obrador's curbing of security cooperation will hurt both countries.

""It will mean more drugs going to the United States and more violence in Mexico,"" he said.

SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE FOOT

The SIU's closure is the latest example of the breakdown in cooperation between the DEA and Mexico since Lopez Obrador assumed power in 2018 and vowed to overhaul the country's security policy.

Angered by the soaring bloodshed he blamed on the heavy-handed tactics of his predecessors, Lopez Obrador sought to implement a less confrontational policing style and pledged to tackle what he claims are the root causes of the violence, such as poverty, instead of hunting down cartel chiefs.

The president also made it harder for foreign security officials to operate inside Mexico, rebuking the DEA over its modus operandi which he said equated to trampling on Mexico's sovereignty.

Privately, U.S. officials say Mexico's vital role in blocking the flow of migrants from Latin America - a priority for Washington - leaves them with limited leverage to pressure Lopez Obrador on other issues, such as security cooperation.

Though the SIU's reputation was damaged when its former chief, Ivan Reyes Arzate, was detained in 2017 and pleaded guilty in a U.S. court to taking bribes to leak tips to a drug gang, the unit was seen as vital by DEA officials who needed Mexican officers to help their investigations in the country.

Alarm bells for the future of the unit rang in 2019, when Lopez Obrador mothballed the Federal Police - inside which the SIU was based - to create a new force called the National Guard.

DEA agents kept working with Mexican counterparts for a while, especially in Mexico City's airport where SIU officers were intercepting smuggled fentanyl, a hyper-potent synthetic drug blamed for soaring overdoses in the United States.

But security cooperation between the DEA and Mexico plummeted to a fresh low in Oct. 2020 when U.S. security officials in Los Angeles detained Mexico's former defense minister Salvador Cienfuegos, alleging he colluded with a drug cartel.

U.S. prosecutors swiftly released Cienfuegos, citing ""sensitive"" foreign policy considerations, but Lopez Obrador accused the DEA of having ""little professionalism"" and of fabricating evidence in the case.

In Dec. 2020, Lopez Obrador's government stripped foreign agents of diplomatic immunity and forced Mexican officials to write reports on interactions with security officers from abroad.

""That was the nail in the coffin,"" the DEA agent said. Months later the SIU was shut down.

By the time the unit was formally wound up it had, according to the DEA agent, already been inoperative for some time as Mexico's National Guard prioritized the deterrence of violence over investigations of drug cartels.

But with more than 33,000 homicides recorded in Mexico last year, Vigil, the ex-DEA agent, said closing an elite unit that goes after organized crime groups responsible for most of the murders doesn't make sense.

""Mexico is shooting itself in the foot,"" he said.

April 19 (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Education has canceled student loan debt for 40,000 people and offered credits to help another 3.6 million pay off their loans under a plan announced on Tuesday designed to aid low-income borrowers and public servants.

""Student loans were never meant to be a life sentence, but it's certainly felt that way for borrowers locked out of debt relief they're eligible for,"" Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said in the statement.

The measures add to other steps taken by the administration of President Joe Biden, including a pause on nearly all student loan collection, but they stop short of demands from the progressive wing of the Democratic Party for comprehensive student loan forgiveness.

Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.com Register

In his 2020 presidential campaign, Biden called for canceling $10,000 in student loan debt for each borrower, a commitment of more than $400 billion. Since he was elected, the White House has said Congress must take action for wider student loan relief.

The government said it was addressing ""historical failures"" to communicate to borrowers all the benefits they were eligible for in federal student loan programs.

At least 40,000 borrowers will receive immediate debt cancellation under the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) Program.

Several thousand borrowers with older loans will also receive forgiveness through income-driven repayment (IDR) forgiveness, plus another 3.6 million borrowers will receive at least three years of additional credit toward IDR forgiveness, the Education Department said in a statement.

Those programs cap the amount lower-income borrowers are required to pay and forgive the remaining balance after a set number of years.

Student loan debt is seen as a drag on the economy, burdening young professionals for years after graduation, while the wide availability of loans has contributed to rising tuition.

Some 43.4 million borrowers are carrying about $1.6 trillion in outstanding student loans from the Federal Loan Portfolio, an average of more than $37,000 each, according to the Education Data Initiative.

The Biden administration canceled more than $17 billion in debt for 725,000 borrowers in its first year in office while also extending a pause on loan repayment that has provided at least temporary relief for 41 million borrowers, the Education Department said.

"Black man shot in back of head by Michigan police, independent autopsy says","April 19 (Reuters) - A Black man who was killed by a Grand Rapids, Michigan, police officer during a traffic stop earlier this month, sparking protests in the city, was shot in the back of the head, a forensic pathologist who performed an independent autopsy said on Tuesday.

During a news conference in Detroit, forensic pathologist Werner Spitz and attorneys for the family of Patrick Lyoya said the autopsy found the 26-year-old was shot once and that the police officer held his gun to the back of Lyoya's head.

""That is now scientific evidence of this tragic killing where his family believes was an execution,"" civil rights attorney Ben Crump said during the news conference.

Spitz said he found no signs of a struggle such as scratches or bruises on Lyoya's body, noting that the only injury was a bullet wound.

He also said he did not know the caliber of bullet that was fired, but that it was a ""powerful bullet"" that killed the man.

The death of Lyoya, a Congolese refugee, outraged members of his family and touched off protests in Grand Rapids by activists who say it represents the latest example of police violence against young Black men.

Lyoya's family is demanding that authorities dismiss the officer who shot him from the force and file criminal charges against him. read more

Grand Rapids police were not immediately available to comment in response to the independent autopsy findings.

Grand Rapids police officials have placed the officer, who has not been named publicly, on administrative leave, and have asked the Michigan State Police to investigate the shooting.

Kent County Chief Medical Examiner Stephen Cohle said in a statement that he performed an autopsy on the day of the incident and prepared a death certificate with the cause and manner of death.

He also said toxicology and tissue results were pending and may take 60 days to be completed and that the full autopsy report will not be made public until the State Police concludes its investigation.

""We have to investigate whether this was a class 'driving while black' case,"" attorney Crump said, noting that the officer was traveling in the opposite direction of Lyoya before the stop.

Last week, police released videos of the incident taken from the dashboard of the officer's squad car, from his body-worn camera and from a neighbor's surveillance camera.

They show Lyoya stepping out of the car on a rainy street, seemingly confused and asking ""What did I do?"" as the policeman repeatedly asks for a driver's license and orders him to get back inside the vehicle.

Lyoya appears to be complying, but then closes the driver's- side door and attempts to walk away, resisting the officer's attempts to handcuff him.

Following a short foot chase, the two men grapple on the lawn, at one point fighting over the officer's stun gun, before Lyoya is shot.

The incident began after the officer stopped Lyoya over suspicions involving his license plate.

"UPDATE 1 Ukraine's military boosts aircraft thanks to spare parts, Pentagon says","The Pentagon is seen from the air in Washington, U.S., March 3, 2022, more than a week after Russia invaded Ukraine. REUTERS/Joshua Roberts

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - Ukraine's military has received additional aircraft as well parts for repairs to get damaged aircraft flying again, the Pentagon said on Tuesday.

Ukraine has defied expectations of allies and military experts by not only keeping its air force operational nearly two months after the start of Russia's invasion but actually repairing aircraft and, apparently, adding to its inventory.

Pentagon spokesman John Kirby did not offer details on which countries provided aircraft, but acknowledged new transfers and said Ukraine had more operable fighter aircraft than it had two weeks ago.

""They have received additional aircraft and aircraft parts to help them get more aircraft in the air,"" Kirby told a news briefing, without elaborating.

Kirby said Washington had not provided any aircraft to Kyiv.

""We certainly have helped with the trans-shipment of some additional spare parts that have helped with their aircraft needs, but we have not transported whole aircraft,"" he said.

Still, that might soon change. The United States has announced plans to transfer Russian-made helicopters to Ukraine that had once been intended for Afghanistan.

More than 50 days into the war, the skies over Ukraine are still contested in part due to Ukraine's fleet of aircraft and air defenses, including portable, shoulder-fired surface-to-air missiles provided by the United States and its allies.

That has allowed Ukraine to wage a much more effective ground campaign than if Russia had air dominance and could defend its invading forces from the skies.

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden is expected to announce within the coming days another military aid package for Ukraine about the same size as the $800 million one announced last week, multiple sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.

One U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a new package was expected that would be roughly the size of the previous package but details were still being worked out.

The latest package was first reported by NBC News.

The Biden administration last week announced $800 million in additional aid, including artillery systems, artillery rounds, armored personnel carriers and unmanned coastal defense boats, broadening the scope of materiel sent to Kyiv to include new types of heavy equipment. read more

If this week's aid package is as large as expected, it would bring total U.S. military aid to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February to well over $3 billion.

Delegate protests over Russia to upstage G20 meeting,"WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - Western nations are preparing to stage coordinated walk-outs and other diplomatic snubs to protest against Russia's invasion of Ukraine at Wednesday's meeting of G20 finance ministers in Washington, their officials said.

While some in Western capitals argue that Russia's actions should mean it is excluded from global meetings altogether, that is not a view shared by others in the Group of 20 big economies, including notably China and Indonesia, which is chairing the group this year.

Moscow confirmed on Tuesday Finance Minister Anton Siluanov would lead Russia's delegation at the talks despite repeated protestations by Western diplomats that they could not go ahead as usual during a war in which thousands of civilians have died in bombardments by Russian troops.

""During and after the meeting we will be certain to send a strong message and we will not be alone in doing so,"" a German government source said, accusing Russia of starting a conflict that has also sent world food and energy prices spiraling.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen plans to avoid G20 sessions joined by Russian officials on the sidelines of International Monetary Fund and World Bank meetings. But Yellen will attend an opening session on the Ukraine war regardless of Russian participation, a U.S. Treasury official said.

British finance minister Rishi Sunak also will not attend certain G20 sessions, a British government source told Reuters. read more

And a French finance ministry official meanwhile expected some ministers from Group of Seven nations to leave their seats when their Russian peer was due to speak.

'UNRAVELING' RISK

The divisions widened by the Ukraine war raise questions over the G20's future as the world's premier economic policy forum.

Conceived as a platform for the biggest wealthy and developing economies to cooperate on recovery efforts during the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, the G20 has since broached everything from global tax reform to pandemic debt relief and the fight against climate change, with a patchy record of success.

""The G20 is at risk of unraveling and this week is incredibly important,"" said Josh Lipsky, director of the Atlantic Council's GeoEconomics Center and a former IMF adviser.

Should Western democracies allow the group to wither in favor of the G7 or other groupings, it would cede significant economic influence to China, Lipsky said.

""Russia can align with China and I think that's a good outcome from Russia's perspective and actually gives them more influence than they have in a body like the G20,"" he said.

Both the French and the German official said there would be no agreed communique at the end of a meeting which had been originally due to discuss the state of the global economy and coordinating vaccine and other pandemic efforts.

Apart from the G7 nations - the United States, Canada, Japan, Britain, France, Germany and Italy - the G20 also incorporates emerging economies including China, India and Brazil that have starkly different views on how the global economy should work.

The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the fact that some G20 nations have chosen not to follow Western sanctions on Russia is only the latest challenge to efforts to construct a global set of rules for trade and finance.

The United States and China have long traded accusations of protectionism, while the fact that world trade is growing more slowly than the global economy as a whole has prompted questions about the future of globalization.

Ahead of the G20 meeting, a top IMF official warned of the risk of a fragmenting global economy.

""One scenario is one where we have divided blocs that are not trading much with each other, that are on different standards, and that would be a disaster for the global economy,"" IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas told reporters.

Separately, the Fund slashed its forecast for global economic growth by nearly a full percentage point, citing Russia's war in Ukraine, and warning inflation was a ""clear and present danger"" for many countries. read more

ATHENS, April 19 (Reuters) - Greece has impounded a Russian oil tanker off the island of Evia, the Greek coastguard said on Tuesday, as part of European Union sanctions imposed on Moscow over its invasion of Ukraine.

Earlier this month, the EU banned Russian-flagged vessels from the 27-nation bloc's ports, with some exemptions, as it adopted new sweeping sanctions against Russia for what the Kremlin describes as a ""special military operation"".

The 115,500-deadweight tonnage Russian-flagged Pegas, with 19 Russian crew members on board, was seized near Karystos on the southern coast of Evia, which lies just off the Greek mainland near Athens.

The Russian embassy in Athens, the Greek capital, said on Twitter that it was looking into the case and was in contact with Greek authorities on the issue.

""It has been seized as part of EU sanctions,"" a Greek shipping ministry official said.

A coastguard official said the ship's oil cargo had not been confiscated. It was not clear who the charterer of the cargo was, but the vessel was managed by Russia-based Transmorflot.

Transmorflot was not immediately available for comment.

The Pegas, which was renamed Lana in March, had earlier reported an engine problem. It was headed to the southern Peloponnese peninsula to offload its cargo onto another tanker but rough seas forced it to moor just off Karystos where it was seized, Athens News Agency reported.

On Tuesday afternoon the ship was still moored at Karystos bay, Reuters witnesses said.

U.S. advocacy group United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI), which monitors Iran-related tanker traffic through ship and satellite tracking, said the Pegas loaded around 700,000 barrels of crude oil from Iran's Sirri Island on Aug. 19, 2021.

It subsequently tried to unload the cargo at a Turkish port before heading to Greece, UANI said its analysis showed.

VILNIUS, April 19 (Reuters) - Lithuania's parliament on Tuesday voted to ban public displays of the letter ""Z"", the black and orange ribbon of St George, and other symbols seen as expressing support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Russian military vehicles in Ukraine are prominently marked with the letter ""Z"", and it has started appearing on social media and on clothing elsewhere in support of the war.

Meanwhile the ribbon of St George, first introduced as an honour by Catherine the Great, has gained significance in the Russian-speaking world since separatists in eastern Ukraine adopted it as a symbol of their support for Russia in 2014.

To an earlier ban on public displays of Soviet and Nazi symbols, parliament added a provision for ""the symbols of totalitarian or authoritarian regimes used in the past or currently use to promote military aggression, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed or perpetrated by them.""

Lawmakers also approved that fines for breaching the ban should be raised to 900 euros ($827) for persons and up to 1,500 euros for companies.

Russian President Vladimir Putin sent his troops into Ukraine on what he calls a ""special military operation"" to demilitarise and ""denazify"" Ukraine. Ukraine and the West say Putin launched an unprovoked war of aggression.

The Lithuanian decision comes after similar bans in Latvia and Moldova. Germany was also considering such ban. read more

KYIV, April 19 (Reuters) - The aim of Russia's new military offensive in east Ukraine is to grab land, establish an overground link between territories in the east and Crimea, and crush Ukraine's armed forces, Ukraine's defence ministry said on Tuesday.

Ministry spokesperson Oleksandr Motuznyak said Russian forces were attacking along the entire frontline in eastern Ukraine, pressing their siege of Mariupol in the south and trying to encircle cities in the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk.

""The goal is to defeat the Ukrainian forces, to establish control over the territory of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions and establish a land corridor to Crimea,"" Motuznyak told a briefing.

Russian-backed separatists who rose up in 2014 have declared so-called people's republics in territory they control in parts of the Luhansk and Donetsk regions.

Ukrainian officials have repeatedly said Moscow wants to seize Mariupol and all the territory that Ukrainian government forces still hold in Luhansk and Donetsk to create a land link with Crimea, which Russia seized and annexed in 2014.

""The main efforts are to break through the positions held by Ukrainian troops and they have not stopped trying to gain full control over Mariupol,"" Motuznyak said.

Summing up Russia's tactics, he said: ""Usually, they are: powerful artillery preparation, an attempt to storm particular positions, attempts to stymie the actions of units of Ukraine's armed forces, attempts to surround our units, and to capture settlements. Russia is mainly waging war according to the textbooks of the Soviet era.""

WASHINGTON, April 19 (Reuters) - The White House announced on Tuesday that it has finalized regulations guiding environmental reviews of major infrastructure projects like highways and pipelines that would consider their climate impacts and other factors.

The White House Council for Environmental Quality has now officially restored key provisions of National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations that had been in place before the Trump administration overhauled the rules last year for the first time in decades.

The change will require federal agencies to consider the “direct,” “indirect,” and “cumulative” impacts of proposed projects or actions, including a full evaluation of climate change impacts and assessment of the impact of releasing additional pollution in communities that are already choked by polluted air or dirty water.

“Restoring these basic community safeguards will provide regulatory certainty, reduce conflict, and help ensure that projects get built right the first time,” said CEQ Chair Brenda Mallory.

In addition to requiring an analysis of climate impacts, the final rule empowers federal agencies to consider alternative designs or approaches for a company's proposed projects and allows agencies to adopt reviews that are more stringent than CEQ's regulations.

The council also announced on Tuesday that it plans to propose a ""phase 2"" NEPA rulemaking in the coming months that will improve the efficiency of the review processes.

Former President Donald Trump in 2020 revamped NEPA in an effort to fast-track major projects like the now-cancelled Keystone XL oil pipeline that he said got caught up in red tape and interfered with his focus on U.S. ""energy dominance.""

His NEPA overhaul allowed federal agencies to exclude the climate impact of a project, allowing major fossil fuel projects to sail through the approval process and avoid legal challenges.

Over the last few years, however, federal courts had ruled that NEPA required the federal government to consider a project’s carbon footprint in decisions relating to leasing public lands for drilling or building pipelines.

Live Updates: Zelensky Says U.S. Secretary of State Will Visit Kyiv; Missiles Hit Odesa,"A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March. The war in Ukraine has stoked fears in Moldova of renewed pressures from Russia.

CHISINAU, Moldova — Before war erupted next door, Moldovans had big plans for their country.

But the Russian invasion of Ukraine put Moldova, a former Soviet republic and one of Europe’s poorest nations, in an extremely vulnerable situation, threatening its economic development, straining its society with waves of refugees and evoking existential fears of yet another Russian occupation.

The war jitters are also adding another chapter to Moldova’s long and increasingly desperate effort to untangle itself from Moscow’s clutches. In pursuit of that, it recently applied to join the European Union, but the prospect of gaining admission anytime soon is remote.

“We are a fragile country in a fragile region,” said Maia Sandu, Moldova’s president, in an interview.

Moldovans’ fears swelled anew on Friday, when a Russian general said his country’s military now plans to seize the entire southern coast of Ukraine. That would establish a land bridge from Russia in the east to Transnistria, a heavily armed, breakaway region in Moldova’s east — bordering Ukraine — that is controlled by Russia.

Whether Russia has the wherewithal to swallow up such a large stretch of Ukrainian territory is debatable, especially in view of the enormous losses its military suffered in the battle for Kyiv. But whether real or just an effort to stir up trouble in the region, the Moldovans are taking the general’s threat seriously.

The Moldovan government has long been nervous about Transnistria, a thin sliver of territory that is controlled by at least 12,000 separatists and Russian troops. Since the war erupted, the Moldovan and Ukrainian militaries have faced the extra concern of whether the Transnistrians were going to jump into the battle and start attacking Ukraine from the west. So far, that has not happened.

Tucked between Romania and Ukraine, Moldova is tiny — with less than three million people — and for centuries has been torn between greater powers: first the Ottomans and Russia, and now Europe and Russia. The theme, clearly, is Russia, and Russia does not want to let it go.

Moscow exerts a stranglehold over nearly 100 percent of Moldova’s energy supply. And the Kremlin is constantly trying to stir up Moldova’s many Russian speakers who are susceptible to its propaganda, especially in Transnistria.

That is what seemed to have happened on Friday, when, according to the Russian news media, Maj. Gen. Rustam Minnekayev said, “Russian control over the south of Ukraine is another way out to Transnistria, where there are cases of Russian-speaking people being oppressed.”

The Moldovan government immediately summoned the Russian ambassador to complain about the general’s statement, saying it was “not only unacceptable but also unfounded” and led to “increased tension.”

For Ms. Sandu, 49, the country’s first female president, it was another hurdle along a dangerous pathway she has been trying to navigate since the crisis began.

Moldova has condemned Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and barred Moldovans from sticking pro-Russia symbols on their cars. At the same time, the country did not fully join the European Union’s sanctions on Russia, for fear of being cut off from Russian gas.

“No one said it was going to be easy,” Ms. Sandu, 49, said from her office on Stefan cel Mare, the grand boulevard in the capital, Chisinau, that cuts past a patchwork of hulking, Soviet-style office buildings. “But no one said it was going to be this hard.”

The war has been hard not only on her but on most everyone here. Before the hostilities started, Adrian Trofim, whose family owns a 19th-century countryside winery and resort, thought that he was finally catching a break after two years of struggling during the coronavirus pandemic. He was adding a wing to the hotel, setting up a spa focused on wine-based treatments and gearing up to produce a sparkling wine.

But now his operations have fallen into peril. Brandy worth a quarter of a million dollars that he needs to ship to Belarus has been blocked in his warehouses. His regular Ukrainian customers have no way of paying him, costing him several more hundreds of thousands of dollars. And he cannot ship his chardonnays to China, one of his new markets, because the port in Odesa, Ukraine, that he uses for exports shut down as soon as the first bombs fell in February.

“I don’t know what to do,” said Mr. Trofim, who may soon have to lay off almost half of his staff. “Everything is frozen until we understand how to live with this situation.”

It could be a while. When the war began in Ukraine, residents of Chisinau said they were awakened by the sounds of not-so-far-off explosions. Then Ukrainian refugees started streaming in — more than 400,000 have arrived, Moldovan officials have said — putting a severe strain on public services in a country where the average annual income is less than $6,000.

Prices for basic goods then shot up as supply chains were disrupted. And business owners had to persuade their employees, terrified that the war might cross into Moldova, not to flee the country, following the hundreds of thousands of Moldovans who moved abroad in the past decade.

“We were already considered a high risk,” said Carmina Vicol, the head of the American Chamber of Commerce in Moldova. “We had just started convincing investors to take a shot on us. Now everyone has backed out.”

It is not all bad news. Some Ukrainian companies are considering moving to Moldova, in search of a safer environment. And with all of the foreign dignitaries (and news crews) swooping in, its international profile has received a lift, leading the government last month to rebrand Moldova as “a small country with a big heart.”

Many Russians discovered that big heart long ago. During Soviet times, retired officers flocked to Moldova, drawn by the scenery, good food and sunshine. After the Soviet Union collapsed, the country was run by pro-Russian elites, who kept strong links with Moscow, especially regarding energy.

Moldova receives all its gas from companies controlled by Russia. And even though Moldovan leaders have talked a big game about weaning the country off Russian gas and getting energy from other countries like Azerbaijan, Turkey and Romania, none of those, at the moment, could come close to what Russia provides.

Image Moldova relies on Russian companies for all of its natural gas supplies, making it vulnerable to pressure from Moscow. Credit... Cristian Movila for The New York Times

And so Russia continues to use its sway over gas prices to push Moldova around. Russia has intimated, for instance, that it would lower prices if Moldova agreed to make concessions on Transnistria, which Moldova has refused.

Moldova’s twin problems, of energy and Transnistria, are interconnected. In the Soviet era, Moldova’s biggest power plant, and its two biggest gas-pumping stations, were built in Transnistria.

“If you look at the map, it doesn’t make sense,” said Victor Parlicov, an energy analyst and a former government official. “It was built this way in case Moldova would try to pursue its own path.”

Transnistria has its own flag, complete with a Soviet-style hammer and sickle, and a separate identity from the rest of Moldova. Its roots go back to the 1920s, when the Soviet Union carved out a small republic in the same area, before incorporating parts of it into the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic during World War II.” Mr. Parlicov said that this fit a pattern of the Soviet authorities reshaping the borders of republics against historical realities, which created the potential for conflict.

Transnistria’s situation mirrors that of Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia-backed separatists rebelled after the anti-Russian 2014 rebellion, setting off a chain of events that led to war. Transnistria also complicates Moldova’s aspirations to join the European Union.

“We’d be happy to be part of the E.U.,” said Serghei Diaconu, the deputy interior minister. But, he added, half-jokingly, Transnistria was “a big pain” that could discourage the E.U. from accepting Moldova.

Joining NATO would be an even taller order. Neutrality is enshrined in Moldova’s constitution, a holdover from the early 1990s, when it tried to stand on its own without antagonizing Russia. Now, Moldova’s leaders are questioning the wisdom of that approach.

“If you ask me whether neutrality is going to keep us safe, I don’t know,” said Ms. Sandu, the president. “It did not help over the last three decades to convince Russia to take its troops out of the country.”

The geopolitical tightrope the country is forced to walk, in the eyes of many Moldovans, means its future is intertwined with Russia’s. Mr. Trofim, the winemaker, for one, said that almost half of his business depended on Russia, Ukraine and Belarus.

As he looked at the winery’s vast, neat gardens, empty but for a few visitors, he said that he was appalled by what Russia had done in Ukraine, but that he could not condemn anyone forever.

“I cannot say I will never do business with Russia,” Mr. Trofim said. “It is a matter of the well-being of my company.”","Anton Troianovski, Cassandra Vinograd, Marc Santora, Victoria Kim, Alexandra Petri, Andrea Kannapell, Farnaz Fassihi, Ivan Nechepurenko",https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/04/23/world/ukraine-russia-war-news/russia-opens-a-criminal-case-accusing-a-pro-democracy-activist-of-spreading-false-information-about-the-war,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/22/world/22ukraine-blog-kara-murza/22ukraine-blog-kara-murza-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes,"A Soviet-era monument in Chisinau, the capital of Moldova, in March.

Mask Ruling Underscores Deep Split in Attitudes,"Wearing masks during the pandemic has long been a divisive issue in the United States. And now that a federal judge has tossed out the mask mandate for planes and public transportation, rules in some places have been thrown into chaos. Many were lifted, and a few reimposed.

But even as the changes cause some confusion, Americans’ attitudes toward the restrictions have wavered little in recent months and, in fact, are still impassioned. Some who are already in the habit of masking in public and see Covid-19 cases rising again in parts of the country are angry at losing the protection they have relied on. Others are elated by the release from those irritating bands behind their ears.

“Ecstatic” was the way Patrick McDonnell, a 30-year-old architect from Brooklyn, described his feelings, adding, “Enough is enough.” Mr. McDonnell said he found wearing a mask “annoying” and “uncomfortable” and has already stopped masking on the New York City subway, even though face coverings are still required on mass transit in the city.

“Adults should be able to make their own decisions regarding the risks they’re willing to take,” Mr. McDonnell said. As for masking for the sake of fellow riders who are older or in poor health, he said that vaccines and treatments are now available for Covid-19, and he should no longer have to alter his behavior to accommodate others.","Roni Caryn Rabin, Emily Erdos",https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/23/health/mask-mandate-transportation-response.html,https://static01.nyt.com/images/2022/04/23/science/23VIRUS-VOICES-MASKS1/23VIRUS-VOICES-MASKS1-facebookJumbo.jpg,NYTimes,"Wearing masks during the pandemic has long been a divisive issue in the United States.

Atlanta Falcons player Grady Jarrett was denied entry to an Atlanta restaurant earlier this week.

Jarrett called out Le Bilboquet in a now-deleted Instagram post, local news reported.

""You ever see someone working [out] in a full Gucci suit?"" he told WXIA-TV.

An NFL player says he was denied entry into an Atlanta restaurant earlier this week due to his attire, according to reports.

Atlanta Falcons defensive end Grady Jarrett claimed that Le Bilboquet, a French restaurant located in Buckhead, turned him away on Wednesday in a now-deleted Instagram post, WSB-TV reported.

According to the report, the football player was donning a casual Gucci tracksuit worth thousand of dollars and a tennis chain when the incident happened.

The outlet noted that in his post Jarrett said other people inside the establishment were dressed in T-shirts and sweatsuits. A photo of Jarrett's outfit was shared on Twitter by WSB-TV reporter Audrey Washington.

""It wasn't a good feeling,"" Jarrett told the outlet.

According to Le Bilboquet's policies, athletic and beach attire, sweatpants, baseball caps, cut denim, and flip flops are prohibited.

""You ever see someone working [out] in a full Gucci suit?"" Jarett said, per WXIA-TV. ""I'm an athlete.""

In a statement to CBS46, the restaurant stood by its dress code policy but apologized to guests they had previously turned away. According to reports, former Atlanta Hawks player Dominque Wilkins was denied entry last year.

""Our dress code (which clearly states that athletic wear is not allowed) is posted at our door, online and reiterated by our reservation team. Last spring, we relaxed our dress code to accommodate Atlanta's more casual environment and required all staff members to undergo extensive sensitivity training,"" the statement said, per the outlet.

The statement continued: ""We never want to turn away guests, but we must treat all guests equally by providing a standard for everyone who wishes to dine with us. Our apologies to anyone who has ever been turned away.""

Jarrett told WXIA-TV he understands that places have dress codes; however, ""for my suit to be classified as athletic wear under their discretion, I just didn't think that was really fitting or correct.""

Last week, former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said that she was denied service at The Captial Grille at Perimeter Mall in Georgia because she was wearing leggings, which she called ""odd.""

""Rules are the rules, just wonder if the woman who came in immediately after me, who I did not see come back out, was also denied service,"" Bottoms tweeted last Friday.

"Falcons star, former mayor turned away from popular restaurants over dress code","An Atlanta Falcons star is calling out a well-known Buckhead restaurant after he says he was refused service because of the way he was dressed.

Linebacker Grady Jarrett said he was trying to have dinner at Le Bilboquet when a manager approached him and told him he wasn’t dressed properly.

Jarrett posted about the incident on his Instagram account over the weekend.

“Not sure if I know how my dress is offensive, maybe it’s the Gucci suit, the Bussdown AP Offshore, the iced double tennis chain w an Ankh and the fact that I pulled up in my 500k RR and they felt I wasn’t fit to bless their restaurant for dinner..

Channel 2′s Audrey Washington was in Buckhead Thursday, where Jarrett told her that he was hurt and embarrassed to be turned away. Jarrett said he was out with his girlfriend when they stopped at the restaurant for lunch.

He said before they could even order, the manger walked up.

“He came up to me and looked me up and down,” Jarrett said.

Jarrett said he was wearing a Gucci track suit worth thousands of dollars -- but that didn’t stop the manager from telling him he was not dressed according to the restaurant’s dress code and asking him to leave.

“It wasn’t a good feeling,” Jarrett said.

Jarrett pointed out that other people in the background of his photo were also wearing casual clothing.

“And the people inside the restaurant as well, but I didn’t want to invade their privacy and take pictures of them,” Jarrett said.

Martin Theis manages the restaurant. He said he was not there when Jarrett was denied service, but said all patrons are asked to follow the dress code.

“We never like upsetting people with the dress code, but it’s something that we do need to maintain,” Theis said.

The dress code reads in part that sweatpants and athletic attire are not allowed.

Last year, a similar incident happened at the same restaurant when a waiter denied basketball legend Dominique Wilkins service because he was wearing a sweatsuit.

Washington asked Jarrett if he thinks the dress code should be abolished all together.

“I don’t think it should go away,” Jarrett said. “I think consistency is the most important thing. Don’t tell me not to do something and you have other people enjoying themselves doing the same thing.”

Jarrett said he wore a similar sweatsuit to the same restaurant last week and was not asked to leave.

The restaurant issued a statement to Channel 2 Action News Thursday night, saying:

“At Le Bilboquet, we value each and every patron and their unique style. However, we have a dress code to maintain a certain standard. Our dress code (which clearly states that athletic wear is not allowed) is posted at our door, online and reiterated by our reservation team. Last spring, we relaxed our dress code to accommodate Atlanta’s more casual environment and required all staff members to undergo extensive sensitivity training. We never want to turn away guests, but we must treat all guests equally by providing a standard for everyone who wishes to dine with us. Our apologies to anyone who has ever been turned away.”

Le Bilboquet isn’t the only restaurant in Atlanta that has been criticized for its dress code enforcement. Former Atlanta mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said she was denied service at the Capitol Grille Saturday because of her leggings.

“Odd that a restaurant in a mall parking lot turns away customers in “mall” attire. Asked if I could sit in the bar area and was told, “No.” Rules are the rules, just wonder if the woman who came in immediately after me, who I did not see come back out, was also denied service,” Bottoms tweeted.

Jarrett is also not the only Atlanta athlete who has spoken out against Le Bilboquet.

NBA Hall of Famer and Hawks legend Dominique Wilkins posted last year a photo on Twitter after the restaurant denied him service. Wilkins believed he was turned away due to the color of his skin.

The restaurant posted a statement about their dress code but later issued an apology to Wilkins.

“We want to apologize to Mr. Wilkins for his experience at our restaurant and also for any confusion our dress code may have caused. We in no way intended for him to feel unwanted, and welcome an open dialogue with him. Our upscale dining experience and our brand’s culture is made up of multiple elements, which include our music, our food and our patrons’ attire. We continue to strive to manifest our dining experience in a way that is exciting and most importantly, inclusive.”

Judge dismisses lawsuit against Tiger Woods' restaurant in death of bartender in crash,"JUPITER — A Palm Beach County judge has thrown out a lawsuit accusing a Jupiter restaurant owned by golfing great Tiger Woods of causing the 2018 alcohol-fueled death of a 24-year-old bartender.

In a decision that is being challenged by a lawyer for the grieving parents of Nicholas Immesberger, Circuit Judge Samantha Schosberg-Feuer ruled that The Woods Jupiter can’t be held responsible for the single-car rollover crash that claimed the life of the young man who struggled with alcohol.

Evidence showed that Immesberger, like other employees, helped himself to pineapple slices soaked in vodka and alcoholic drinks before leaving the restaurant to head home, she wrote.

“There is no evidence that Immesberger paid The Woods, or was asked to pay, for any of the alcoholic beverages he consumed on Dec. 10, 2018,” Schosberg-Feuer said in the 15-page ruling.

Tiger Woods is an investor in a restaurant called The Woods at Harbourside in Jupiter.

Citing a series of Florida Supreme Court decisions, she said restaurants and bars can be held liable for a patron’s death only if they “knowingly” serve a person who is “habitually addicted” to alcohol or is a minor.

Since Immesberger wasn’t served or what Schosberger-Feuer called “vended,” the restaurant didn’t run afoul of state law, she concluded.

Attorney Barry Postman, who represents the popular Harbourside Place restaurant, applauded the ruling that was issued in March.

“We’re very pleased that the judge appropriately applied the law and found that Mr. Immesberger’s parents didn’t have a basis to bring a claim against The Woods,” he said.

Initially, both Woods and his girlfriend, Erica Herman, who managed the sprawling restaurant near the Intracoastal Waterway, were named in the lawsuit. They were dropped when no evidence surfaced that they were at the eatery on the day of the fatal crash.

A family photo of Nicholas Immesberger, who was killed in a car crash, shown at a press conference Tuesday, May 14, 2019, where the family announced they are suing Tiger Woods, his restaurant The Woods, and his girlfriend Erica Herman. They accuse the Jupiter restaurant of serving him excessive amounts of alcohol. Herman is the general manager of The Woods, where Immesberger was employed as a bartender.

Postman voiced confidence that Schosberg-Feuer’s decision would be upheld on appeal. But an attorney for Immesberger’s parents, Mary Katherine Belowsky and Scott Duchene, disagreed.

“She ruled that if you give away free alcohol, you can’t be held liable under Florida’s Dram Shop law,” attorney Spencer Kuvin said. “I believe she is dead wrong.”

Kuvin has already appealed Schosberg-Feuer’s decision. But before the 4th District Court of Appeal reviews it, Schosberg-Feuer agreed to give the case another look.

At a hearing scheduled for June 24, she agreed to consider Kuvin’s claims that she got it wrong.

Tiger Woods, seen here celebrating his win at the 2019 Masters Tournament in August, Georgia, is an investor in the restaurant bearing his name at Harbourside Place in Jupiter.

In court papers, Kuvin said Schosberg-Feuer strayed far from past court decisions and common sense.

“No court has conclusively held that 'vendors' … are absolved from liability because (they) did not 'sell' or 'take money' from the 'habitual drunkard,’ "" Kuvin wrote. ""If this were to be the case, then vendors (bars, taverns, or restaurants) could freely hand out or pour alcohol free of charge with no consequences to its actions.""

Postman countered that Kuvin is misinterpreting both the law and Schosberg-Feuer’s ruling. The Woods didn’t ""knowingly serve” Immesberger, he wrote. Therefore, it can’t be held responsible for his death.

But, Kuvin said, at least one fellow employee said Immesberger was drunk when he left the restaurant.

In a sworn statement, server Jenna Brodeur said when she gave Immesberger a hug, ""I could smell the booze and he was sweaty.”

Managers, who knew the young man attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, should have stopped him from getting into his grandfather's 1999 Chevy Corvette and driving off, Kuvin argued.

But, Postman said, three other employees said they didn’t think Immesberger was intoxicated. Brodeur also said she never saw anyone serve Immesberger and didn’t know he was an alcoholic.

Postman also objected to Kuvin’s claims that Brodeur offers new evidence of wrongdoing. Kuvin has known about Brodeur since shortly after the suit was filed in 2019.

Further, he claimed, rather than shore up Kuvin's claims, Brodeur's statements underscore Schosberg-Feuer’s conclusion that the restaurant is blameless.

All sides agree that the case is incredibly tragic. Immesberger was raised by his mother, who didn’t tell him about his father until he was in his teens, Kuvin said. As he and his father were building a relationship, his younger half-brother committed suicide. His personal struggles spurred him to seek comfort in alcohol, he said.

“Nick needed help. He didn’t need encouragement for drinking,” Kuvin said.

Toxicology tests conducted after Immesberger’s death showed he had had a blood-alcohol level of 0.256 – more than three times the 0.08 percent mark at which Florida drivers are presumed to be impaired. His blood also showed traces of THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.

Woods, who was arrested on drunken driving charges after a single-vehicle crash in Jupiter in 2017 and entered a court diversion program, talked about Immesberger's death shortly after the suit was filed.

Speaking to reporters before playing in the PGA Championship golf tournament on Long Island, New York, Woods said he and the restaurant staff were devastated.

“It was a terrible night, terrible ending,” he said. “We feel bad for him and his entire family. It's very sad.""

"Yankees, Jacoby Ellsbury quietly settled 2019 grievance 'at least a year ago': report","Jacoby Ellsbury swinging in pinstripes Yankees

Back in 2019, the Yankees filed a grievance against former outfielder Jacoby Ellsbury, looking to recoup some of the money the team owed him as part of his seven-year, $153 million contract.

According to a report from the New York Post, the Yankees and Ellsbury quietly settled that grievance “at least a year ago” to avoid a hearing.

The grievance was filed when the team released the oft-injured outfielder in November 2019, when he still had $21 million and one year remaining on the contract, along with a $5 million buyout, that the team converted to non-guaranteed money. The MLBPA subsequently filed a grievance on Ellsbury’s behalf to make the team pay the remaining money.

The Yankees claimed that Ellsbury used an outside facility, without the team’s permission, to rehab during 2018 and 2019. Ellsbury missed both seasons due to a variety of injuries, starting with an oblique strain before a lower-back issue popped up. The former Boston Red Sox outfielder then had surgery for a torn labrum that ended any chance of playing in 2019.

In all, Ellsbury played 520 games over the span of four seasons with the Yankees, slashing .264/.330/.386 with 39 home runs, 198 RBI and 273 runs scored.",Alex Smith,https://sports.yahoo.com/yankees-jacoby-ellsbury-quietly-settled-022108785.html,https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/jow5GN5CmFbYBg5UCljdQA--~B/aD0yNTA7dz00NDQ7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/sny_articles_235/f1ce8e21d1a9a1d53fd8e0c03cbd7e00,Yahoo,"Jacoby Ellsbury swinging in pinstripes Yankees

Scottie Barnes just barely beats Evan Mobley for Rookie of the Year award,"In the closest Rookie of the Year award vote in nearly two decades, Toronto Raptors standout Scottie Barnes came out on top. Barnes narrowly defeated Cleveland Cavaliers rookie Evan Mobley, winning the 2021-22 NBA Rookie of the Years award Saturday.

Barnes, 20, also beat out Cade Cunningham of the Detroit Pistons for the award. The three players were named finalists for the Rookie of the Year award Sunday.

Barnes received 48 first-place votes, helping him net a total of 378 points. Mobley finished just 15 points behind Barnes, making it the closest Rookie of the Year vote in this voting format.

The 15-point difference between the NBA Rookie of the Year winner (Scottie Barnes) and the second-place finisher (Evan Mobley) is the smallest margin since the current voting format began 19 years ago.

"Miguel Cabrera becomes 33rd MLB player to enter 3,000 hit club","Miguel Cabrera has officially entered one of MLB's most exclusive clubs.

The Detroit Tigers first baseman recorded the 3,000th hit of his career on Saturday at Detroit's Comerica Park, making him the 33rd player in MLB history to reach a milestone widely considered to be an automatic ticket to Cooperstown.

Cabrera picked up the milestone hit in his first at-bat of the game. On the third pitch of Cabrera's at-bat against Colorado Rockies starter Antonio Senzatela, Cabrera sent a single through the right side of the infield for his 3,000th hit.

Cabrera entered the 2022 season needing only 13 hits to reach 3,000, making it a simple matter of ""when."" Only two other players have registered their 3,000th hit in a Tigers uniform and they're both Detroit legends: Ty Cobb and Al Kaline. He is also the first Venezuelan player to enter the club.

Cabrera also entered the 500-homer club last August, making him only the seventh player in MLB history to enter both clubs. The other six: Albert Pujols, Alex Rodriguez, Rafael Palmeiro, Eddie Murray, Hank Aaron and Willie Mays.

All of this adds up to a very easy Hall of Fame case for a player who spent years as one of the big leagues' most feared sluggers.

Miguel Cabrera has a slam-dunk Hall of Fame case

Cabrera's MLB career goes all the way back to 2003, when he was a 20-year-old rookie thrust into the Florida Marlins' World Series run. Cabrera signed with the Marlins as an international free agent out of Venezuela in 1999 and quickly established himself as a top prospect.

Scouting reports at the time don't hail Cabrera as a defensive standout in the infield or a speedster on the bases, but they loved his ability to make contact, his bat speed and his work ethic. All of that would turn out to be prescient, starting with a rookie season that saw him produce at an above-average clip as one of the majors' youngest players and deliver some big hits in the 2003 World Series against the New York Yankees.

Story continues

Cabrera would only get better from there, notching back-to-back Silver Sluggers at third base in the third and fourth years of his career while becoming a perennial MVP candidate. His Florida career came to an end in 2007, when the ever-belt-tightening Marlins traded him to the Tigers for a bounty of prospects, none of whom would come close to matching the slugger's success on the diamond.

Cabrera found even more success in Detroit, notching five Silver Sluggers, four batting titles, two MVP awards and the Triple Crown in 2012. From 2008 to 2016, he hit .330/.412/.578 with 34 homers and 113 RBIs per season. He never got a ring in Detroit, unlike Florida, but he figures to enter Cooperstown in a Tigers hat.

Now playing at 39 years old, Cabrera's skills have taken a bit of a step back. It has been six years since he hit .300 in a season and he only hit .256/.316/.386 with 15 homers in 130 games last season. His value to the Tigers now lies more in the mentorship role, as the team tries to ride its new wave of youth back to contention.

Whether Cabrera, who has one more guaranteed season left on his contract, is around for that potential success remains to be seen, but he doesn't have much left to prove. The only players in the 3,000-hit club who are not in the Hall of Fame are either not currently eligible (e.g. Ichiro Suzuki, Adrian Beltre) or marred by scandal (Pete Rose, Rafael Palmeiro).",,https://sports.yahoo.com/miguel-cabrera-tigers-mlb-enter-3000-hit-club-173135392.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/DCVpzPeQPNqjnIIhaxGS4w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/575c4020-c10a-11ec-bbff-95972655d0af,Yahoo,"Miguel Cabrera has officially entered one of MLB's most exclusive clubs.

Orioles ace John Means to undergo Tommy John surgery after breakout season,"One of the Baltimore Orioles' best building blocks will miss the entire 2022 MLB season. Left-handed ace John Means announced Saturday that he will undergo Tommy John surgery. The procedure will likely keep Means sidelined until next season.

Means made two starts this season before experiencing elbow pain. He underwent multiple MRIs, which determined Means needed surgery to repair the issue.

Means, 28, said he was ""disappointed, but more motivated than ever"" upon hearing the news.

Means experienced a strong year in 2019, but made an even bigger impact for the Orioles in 2021. Means posted a 3.62 ERA over 146 2/3 innings with the club. His biggest moment of the season came in May, when Means threw a no-hitter against the Seattle Mariners. Means missed time late in the 2021 season due to shoulder soreness. He's started on opening day the past two seasons.

Orioles off to impressive start on the mound

The injury comes at a disappointing time, as the rest of the Orioles' pitching staff appears to have found another gear this offseason. Despite not having many household names, the Orioles have a 2.80 ERA through 14 games. That figure ranks fifth in all of baseball. The team also has a 3.00 FIP, which ranks fourth.

Jorge López and Bruce Zimmermann are among the team's biggest pitching wins thus far. López has a 2.25 ERA through 8 innings and has saved three games. His strikeout rate is way up, potentially due to increased velocity. After averaging 95.3 mph on his sinker last season, López is averaging 97.9 on the pitch in 2022.

Zimmermann's velocity is down, but his secondary offerings have looked better to start the season. Zimmermann is relying on his changeup more in 2022. The pitch has a 39.5 percent whiff rate, up from last season. He hasn't used his slider as much this season, but he has a 70 percent whiff rate on the pitch in 26 attempts.

Losing Means for the entire season will hurt, but if the Orioles continue to show improvement on the mound, he could return to pretty intriguing staff in 2023.",,https://sports.yahoo.com/orioles-ace-john-means-to-undergo-tommy-john-surgery-after-breakout-season-163637371.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/F6Xdp0qqmkUsgydIl7gESg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD03OTU-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2022-04/35acc6f0-c323-11ec-bff5-7c00a0b334ff,Yahoo,"One of the Baltimore Orioles' best building blocks will miss the entire 2022 MLB season.

Tom Brady creates $9 million in cap space for Buccaneers after restructuring contract,"Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady's biggest contribution to the NFL ... well, other than all the winning, might be his willingness to put his team in a better place every offseason. Brady did that again Friday, restructuring his contract.

The move gave the Buccaneers an extra $9 million in cap space for the 2022 NFL season, according to ESPN's Adam Schefter.

Tom Brady and the Buccaneers restructured his 2022 contract today, creating over $9 million of added salary cap space for Tampa Bay as it gets ready to head into next week’s draft, league sources tell ESPN. Brady still is scheduled to be a free agent after this season. — Adam Schefter (@AdamSchefter) April 22, 2022

This is nothing new for Brady. He started restructuring his contract as a member of the New England Patriots. Every offseason, Brady would re-work his deal to give the Patriots — and now the Buccaneers — more cap room. The team would then use that cap space to give Brady a better supporting cast.

Brady will make the same amount of money after the restructure. He's not taking a pay cut. Instead, the team shifted how Brady's contract gets paid out. In Brady's case, that might include reducing his 2022 salary to the league minimum, but shifting the money he was supposed to make to his bonus.

I don’t know the fine print yet, but to save $9 million they are not only reducing salary to a minimum and shifting rest into bonus but also tweaking incentives to make them not count as likely to be earned. https://t.co/8j2UV5y6Bc — Greg Auman (@gregauman) April 22, 2022

That enables the team to still pay Brady the same amount, but improve its short-term cap situation.

The Buccaneers will likely use some of their new cap space to sign the players they select in the 2022 NFL draft. The team should still have cap space left after making those moves.

Other quarterbacks follow Tom Brady's lead

Brady may be credited with popularizing the restructuring trend, but many others have picked up on the practice. Former New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees kept restructuring his deal to save the team cap space. Kansas City Chiefs star Patrick Mahomes made the same move last offseason to put the Chiefs in a better spot financially.

While Brady was willing to adjust his deal with the Buccaneers, he did not add any more time to his contract. Brady will be a free agent following the 2022 NFL season.

"Why Jane Fonda, 84, Didn’t Think She’d Live Past 30: ‘The Fact That I’m Still Alive Is a Big Surprise’","Photo credit: David Livingston - Getty Images

Jane Fonda candidly revealed that she didn’t expect to live past 30 years old.

“Just, the fact that I’m alive and thriving is a big surprise,” she admitted.

A trying childhood and fraught relationships with both her parents, as well as three failed marriages haven’t made life easy for the 84-year-old.

Jane Fonda’s childhood was anything but easy. When she was 12 she lost her mother, who battled bipolar disorder. That loss was compounded by a “fraught adolescence” with an emotionally cold father, she once told People, which filled her with insecurities and loneliness. That’s why, after enduring so much turmoil, Fonda is shocked that she’s lived past 30.

“I never thought I would live this long,” she recently told Variety. “In a year, I’m making three movies. If you would’ve told me that at [nearing] 85, I’d be—three movies—I would not have believed it. I didn’t think that I would live past 30. So just, the fact that I’m alive and thriving is a big surprise. ”

Fonda’s mother died by suicide, and for much of her life, Fonda says she blamed herself for her mother’s passing. And it wasn’t until she dedicated her 2005 memoir to her, that, through research and medical records, she was able to really understand her mom’s history.

“When you go through that kind of research … if you can come to answers, which I was able to do, you end up being able to say, ‘It had nothing to do with me,’” she told People in 2018. “It wasn’t that I wasn’t lovable. They had issues,” she added, referring to both of her parents. “And the minute you know that, you can feel tremendous empathy for them. And you can forgive.”

In addition to feeling abandoned by her mom, Fonda’s looks were consistently criticized by her father, renowned actor Henry Fonda. “I was taught by my father that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly,” she told Harper’s Bazaar in 2011. “He sent messages to me that fathers should not send: ‘Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved.’”

Story continues

That sentiment deeply impacted Fonda and contributed to her longtime struggle with bulimia. “I wasn’t very happy from, I would say, puberty to 50,” she added. She was also married three times—to Roger Vadim, Tom Hayden, and Ted Turner—before finally deciding to choose her happiness over a man. “I would tend to mold myself according to what my then-husband wanted me to be,” she explained to Bazaar.

So, for Fonda to be not only alive, but to be enthusiastically doing what she loves right now feels a bit unreal. In 2018, she told Ellen DeGeneres on her talkshow that she thought she’d “die lonely and probably from alcohol or something like that,” adding: “The fact that I’m not an addict, and I’m 80 and I’m working—it’s just a miracle to me.”

The latter half of Fonda’s career is just as, if not more impactful than its beginning, especially thanks to projects like Grace and Frankie. Plus, the 9 to 5 star has grown immensely as a person since her early days, which is really what pushed her to keep going.

“If you have a whole lot of time behind you and just a little in front of you, as is the case with me, I can look back and say, ‘Well, I’ve survived that,’” she told DeGeneres. “Every day I get up, and I want to pinch myself. I feel very blessed, but I’ve worked for it.”

How a Civil War-era law has brought Marjorie Taylor Greene into court,"A group of Georgia voters is hoping an arcane Constitutional law could knock U.S. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene off the ballot.

Greene, R-Ga., on Friday testified in an administrative hearing on a challenge to her candidacy for reelection, raised by a group of Georgia voters, who claim that the congresswoman helped facilitate the Jan. 6 Capitol riot. The riot stemmed from efforts to stop the certification of Joe Biden's presidential election win.

Under a rarely-used provision of the 14th Amendment, she could be disqualified from the ballot. Here's what you need to know about the provision and how its influencing the 2022 midterm elections.

Judge's ruling: Georgia voters can challenge Marjorie Taylor Greene's run on 14th Amendment grounds

History of the provision

The 14th Amendment, which is comprised of five sections, was ratified in 1868, shortly after the Civil War came to an end. It was meant to put the Union's idea of what it accomplished during the Civil War into the Constitution, said Eric Foner, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at Columbia University.

Part of that was ensuring that formerly enslaved people were extended the liberties and rights granted by the Bill of Rights. For example, the 14th Amendment granted citizenship to ""all persons born or naturalized in the United States"" and cemented that no state could deprive any person of ""life, liberty or property, without due process of law"" nor deny anyone equal protection under the law.

But a lesser-known intention of the amendment was to encourage ""loyal government"" in the South.

""In other words, people holding office would not be former Confederates,"" Foner said. ""(The North) didn't fight the Civil War in order to put Confederates back into power in the South.""

The amendment's third section reads:

""No person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability.""

Story continues

That means any former government official or military officer who promised to uphold the Constitution can't serve again if they engage in insurrection unless two-thirds of the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate each votes to pardon them, said Gerard Magliocca, a constitutional law professor at Indiana University.

The provision, however, isn't a formal punishment, Foner said.

""It's not a crime; it's a qualification for office,"" he said. ""It's like being 35 years old. If AOC decided right now to run for president, somebody could go to court and say she can't run because she's not 35 years old.""

Has the provision been cited before?

Greene isn't the only lawmaker whose reelection bid has been questioned on the basis of the provision recently. North Carolina voters challenged Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn's candidacy, but that effort was struck down by a judge in early March. Indiana voters also sought to keep Republican Rep. Jim Banks off the ballot, an effort rejected by Indiana officials in February.

The rule was enforced in a number of cases during Reconstruction, removing office-holders for previously holding positions in the Confederacy. But since then, its use has been ""very rare,"" according to Foner.

""If you walked into a law school today, you would be hard pressed to find anybody who knew anything about this section, even though it's been in the constitution for 150 years,"" Foner said.

Since Reconstruction, the provision has only been cited once.

Wisconsin Rep. Victor Berger, the first Socialist elected to Congress, was convicted under the Espionage Act in 1919 and subsequently barred from Congress after the Senate and House asserted he supported insurrection by opposing American participation in World War I. The Supreme Court in 1921 overturned Berger's conviction.

Victor Berger

""The court said, 'No, no, you can't kick the guy out for this, or, at least, you can't prosecute him for simply his opinion, that is the U.S. should not be in the war,'"" Foner said. ""So his conviction was overturned and then Congress said, 'Well, alright, I guess we have to let him back in.' ""

Berger rejoined Congress in 1923 and served three additional terms, according to House archives.

Section 3 is regaining relevance in the wake of the Jan. 6 Capitol riot.

""The January 6th Capitol riot is widely understood as an insurrection,"" Magliocca said. ""As a result, those officials or former officials who engaged in that insurrection could be disqualified from further service.""

What does that mean today?

Because the provision has rarely been used, its execution is uncharted territory, experts say.

Paul Campos, a constitutional law professor at University of Colorado-Boulder, said ""these people can and should be barred from federal office via Section 3.""

Greene is the only Congress member whose challenge has been allowed to proceed.

Magliocca said that the application of Section 3 will be determined by courts and that ""at least one"" of the challenges will likely succeed. State law largely determines who can bring a challenge, he added.

The challenge to Greene's candidacy will likely reach the Supreme Court, unless thrown out first, Foner said. But once there, it's hard to know how the Court will proceed.

Additional context: Georgia voters argue Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene isn't eligible to be reelected

""The Supreme Court chose the president back in 2000 with Bush v. Gore; it seems like they're not modest about walking into things about candidates,"" Foner said. ""But on the other hand, you never know. This is so unprecedented that you actually really can't predict what people on the Court would say in a case like this.""

Alternatively, the challenge could skip the courts all together. Campos said that Congress can enforce the provision, both in terms of its own internal rules and by statute.

""Theoretically, the House in a majority vote could just say, 'Well, she's not qualified anymore,' "" Foner said.

It's not likely discussion about the provision will soon cease. Though the rule could influence midterms now, it might also take center stage in the 2024 general election.

""If Donald Trump decides to run again for President, he will be subjected to a Section 3 challenge,"" Magliocca predicted.

"DeSantis targeting Disney is a 'boneheaded move' and shows he's trying to be 'king of Florida,' says Rep. Charlie Crist","US Rep. Charlie Crist criticizes Gov. Ron DeSantis as ""un-American"" for targeting Disney with special session bills on April 20, 2022, at the Capitol in Tallahassee, Florida. Phil Sears/AP

Rep. Charlie Crist said Gov. Ron DeSantis wants to be the ""king of Florida"" after targeting Disney.

DeSantis signed a bill on Friday stripping Disney of its self-governing status.

Crist, a Democrat in Congress and former Florida governor, is running for his old job against DeSantis.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' decision to strip Disney of its self-governing status was slammed as a ""boneheaded move"" by a former Florida governor.

Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, who served as Florida's governor from 2007 to 2011 as a Republican, criticized DeSantis in a tweet.

""Attacking Disney, threatening to harm our state's economic powerhouse that creates so many jobs and brings in so many tourism dollars is a boneheaded move however you look at it. Ron's a threat to our state's economy and he's gotta go in November,"" Crist said in the tweet on Friday.

In an interview with the South Florida Sun-Sentinel on Thursday, Crist said DeSantis seems to want to be the ""king of Florida,"" calling the sitting governor ""an angry dude.""

""What he's trying to do is have a one-man rule of this great state,"" Crist told the Sentinel. ""This governor seems to really want to centralize all power in himself.""

Crist is running for governor to unseat DeSantis. He was recently endorsed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, The Hill's Max Greenwood reported.

DeSantis signed a bill on Friday to dissolve Walt Disney World of its self-governing capabilities by June 2023. It comes after Disney slammed Florida's controversial Parental Rights in Education legislation, dubbed by activists and critics as the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill.

The LGBTQ legislation was signed into law by Gov. Ron DeSantis on March 28 and is set to take effect on July 1. It would, in general, ban discussions of sexuality and gender identity in classrooms from kindergarten to third grade and would allow parents to sue schools if staff members facilitate those conversations.

Story continues

The day DeSantis signed the bill into law, Disney issued a statement vowing to advocate for the law's repeal, saying it ""should never have passed and should never have been signed into law.""

On Thursday, Crist told the Sentinel that Disney was being ""punished"" by DeSantis.

""They're being punished for defying this governor and not living up to what he wanted them to do, to support this law that was so offensive to so many in our state. And this is how he responds?"" Crist told the outlet. ""That's not serving with a servant's heart. That's wanting to be the king of Florida. Well, he's not.""

Florida's Senate Minority Leader Gary Farmer told Insider that DeSantis' public dispute with Disney is shifting attention from other legislative items on DeSantis' agenda — namely, the new proposed redistricting map that would give the GOP an edge in the state at the expense of Black voters.

""Governor DeSantis' attack on Disney was designed to act as a smokescreen for the much more devious original and singular purpose of this special session, the passage of a racist and unconstitutional redistricting plan,"" Farmer said.

In a tweet on Thursday, Crist appeared to agree, saying DeSantis' redistricting plan ""silenced Black and brown voices.""

Disney government dissolution bill signed by DeSantis,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) — Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill on Friday to dissolve the private government Walt Disney World controls on its property in the state, punishing the entertainment giant for opposing a new law that critics call “Don’t Say Gay.”

The move is expected to have huge tax implications for Disney and further sour the relationship between the Republican-led government and a major political player whose theme parks have transformed Orlando into one of the world's most popular tourist destinations.

For DeSantis, the attack on Disney is the latest front in a culture war waged over policies involving race, gender and the coronavirus, battles he has harnessed to make himself one of the most popular Republicans in the country and a likely 2024 presidential candidate.

The law would eliminate the Reedy Creek Improvement District, as the 55-year-old Disney government is known, as well as a handful of other similar districts by June 2023. The measure does allow for the districts to be reestablished, leaving an avenue to renegotiate the future of the deal that allows the company to provide services such as zoning, fire protection, utilities and infrastructure.

DeSantis said Friday that the company would end up paying more taxes than it currently does and that the law isn't expected to cause tax increases for residents around Disney. He gave no additional details.

The dispute began with Disney’s criticism of a new law barring instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade as well as instruction that is not “age appropriate or developmentally appropriate.” DeSantis and his fellow Republicans have defended the law as reasonable, saying that parents, not teachers, should be discussing such topics with children.

Under mounting pressure, Disney eventually said it would suspend political donations in the state and that it would support organizations working to oppose the new law.

Story continues

“You're a corporation based in Burbank, California, and you're gonna marshal your economic might to attack the parents of my state,” DeSantis said Friday before signing the bill into law at a ceremony in Hialeah Gardens. “We view that as a provocation, and we're going to fight back against that.""

The governor has hammered Disney for coming out against the bill, portraying the company as a purveyor of “woke” ideology that injects inappropriate subjects into children's entertainment. In a fundraising pitch sent out this week, DeSantis told supporters, “It took a look under the hood to see what Disney has become to truly understand their inappropriate influence.”

Republican Rep. Randy Fine, sponsor of the bill to eliminate the Disney district, has said Disney is a guest in the state and that Floridians are not interested in the company's California values.

“You kick the hornet’s nest, things come up,” Fine told lawmakers in the GOP-controlled statehouse this week.

Democrats have slammed the Disney measure as petty retaliation, warning that homeowners could face tax bills if they have to absorb costs from the company, though details are far from clear.

“The devil is in the details and we don’t yet today have the details,” said Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings, whose county is partially home to Disney World. He added it would be “catastrophic for our budget” if the county had to assume the costs for public safety at the theme park resort.

Disney is one of Florida’s biggest private employers, last year saying it had more than 60,000 workers in the state. It is not immediately clear how the company or local governments around its properties would be affected if the district was dissolved.

The creation of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, and the control it gave Disney over 27,000 acres (11,000 hectares) in Florida, was a crucial element in the company’s plans to build near Orlando in the 1960s. Company officials said they needed autonomy to plan a futuristic city along with the theme park. The city never materialized, however; instead, it morphed into the Epcot theme park.

The company is a major political player in Florida, as well as the rest of the country. The Walt Disney Co. and its affiliates made more than $20 million in political contributions to both Republicans and Democrats in the 2020 campaign cycle, the most recent year for which figures are available, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks such spending.

That same year, Disney-related entities funneled $10.5 million to the America First Action committee, which supports Republican former President Donald Trump. Disney also contributed $1.2 million to support Democratic President Joe Biden’s campaign.",Anthony Izaguirre,https://news.yahoo.com/disney-government-dissolution-bill-signed-192203693.html,https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/w60QlUUVHZ7SFHYjrdlygw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/mFVDW3t5jpteoe9wv2xFSQ--~B/aD0zNTQ5O3c9NTMyNDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ap.org/ff04a724589cbcf331496d6afbdc6d6b,Yahoo,"TALLAHASSEE, Fla.

Is it worth provoking Putin to add Sweden and Finland to NATO?,"“The 360” shows you diverse perspectives on the day’s top stories and debates.

What’s happening

Sweden and Finland, two European nations that have long valued strategic neutrality, appear to be inching closer to joining NATO in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.

“The security landscape has completely changed,” Swedish Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson told reporters last week at a meeting with her Finnish counterpart, Sanna Marin. Andersson’s recent comments represent a significant shift in her view on the value of NATO membership. Early last month , she said that Sweden joining the alliance would “further destabilize this area of Europe and increase tensions.”

Andersson’s change in opinion is indicative of evolving views among the citizens of both countries in reaction to the steady stream of horrifying news out of Ukraine. In a recent poll, 68% of Finns said they support joining NATO , up from just 24% last year. For the first time ever, a majority of Swedes said they also favor joining, according to a poll released this week.

Although both nations have deep cultural and economic ties with Europe, Finland and Sweden have historically declined to pursue NATO membership — even as more than a dozen countries in eastern Europe have joined the alliance since the fall of the Soviet Union. Sweden’s resistance is rooted in its policy of neutrality, which dates back to the early 1800s. After fighting off a Soviet invasion during World War II, Finland established a formally neutral position, largely to avoid provoking further aggression.

Formed in the aftermath of World War II, NATO is a military alliance built on the principle of collective defense — meaning that all NATO countries agree to come to the defense of any individual member that comes under attack. Russia considers NATO to be a direct threat, and Russian President Vladimir Putin said the possibility that Ukraine might join motivated his decision to launch the Russian invasion. Russia’s Foreign Ministry has warned of “serious military and political consequences” if Sweden and Finland join the alliance.

Story continues

Why there’s debate

Supporters say there are clear benefits to adding Sweden and Finland to NATO. They argue that the invasion serves as a startling reminder of how dangerous it can be for countries on Russia’s borders. If they were NATO members, the two Nordic countries would have the force of some of the world’s most powerful militaries — including the U.S. — as a bulwark against any Russian incursion.

Some defense analysts believe NATO and its members have plenty to gain by bringing in Sweden and Finland. Though both nations are relatively small, experts say their militaries are still formidable. The two countries would also provide a valuable strategic foothold along Russia’s northwest flank, particularly along Finland’s 830-mile border with Russia. Others say expanding NATO would be yet another nonmilitary means of punishing Putin for his assault on Ukraine.

But skeptics worry about potential retaliation from Putin, particularly at a time when he’s vulnerable and liable to lash out. Some also argue that increasing NATO’s foothold along Russia’s border would create opportunities for conflict that could spiral into another world war.

There are also those who believe that NATO shouldn't exist at all. Some on the right believe that the alliance allows smaller nations to neglect their own defense capabilities, knowing that major powers will come to their rescue. Observers on the far left, on the other hand, say that anything that promotes military force over nonviolent forms of collaboration is ultimately harmful to the world.

What’s next

There are two major steps that need to be taken before Sweden and Finland could become part of NATO. First, their Parliaments would have to formally vote to join. Then, the legislatures of each of the 30 current NATO countries would have to approve their membership — a process that has taken about a year in the recent past.

Perspectives

Supporters

The war in Ukraine has made it obvious why Sweden and Finland should join

“Who can blame the Finns and the Swedes for wanting to jump right in? … After seeing what's happening to Ukraine, they don’t want to be the next Ukraine. And it’s clear that Putin does not want to challenge any of the NATO countries directly.” — Kevin Baron, Defense One executive editor, to MSNBC

Russia probably isn’t willing to go to war to keep Sweden and Finland out of NATO

“Putin views Finland and Sweden differently than Ukraine because of their different histories. Ukraine is seen as part of an imagined ‘Russian world’ by Putin. Sweden and Finland are, therefore, less comparable to Ukraine, beyond their proximity to Russia.” — Thomas O Falk, Al Jazeera

Adding new NATO members is a sound, nonmilitary way to punish Russia

“It would be a dramatic reversal of fortunes and would demonstrate the agility of the liberal democratic countries in applying the diplomatic element of power, well below the threshold of war, that gray-zone space in which Russia — and, for that matter, China — has been so nimble in the recent past.” — Michael Miklaucic, The Hill

Both countries would bring plenty of benefits to the NATO alliance

“Finland and Sweden wouldn’t be alliance freeloaders. Their strategic location in the Baltic Sea could be critical in a wider conflict with Russia. Finland already punches above its weight militarily, and wealthy Sweden can afford its announced defense-spending increases. A secure Europe better capable of defending itself serves American interests.” — Editorial, Wall Street Journal

Ukraine is a reminder of our responsibility to protect each other

“Ukraine is a game-changer in European security. The real threat to fellow member-states leaves us all with no option but to look again at how we see our responsibilities to one another.” — Editorial, Irish Times

NATO membership would have saved Ukraine

“If only NATO was more popular amongst Ukrainians and properly marketed as a security guarantee against Russia, Ukraine could have been saved from eight or more years of violence and suffering. The lesson to be learned is that NATO did not enlarge far or fast enough.” — Daniel Ramallo, National Interest

Skeptics

Russia might attack to keep Sweden and Finland out

“Would Russia seriously consider an attack on Finland or Sweden? While it may seem unlikely, the West should not underestimate the possibility that Mr. Putin, feeling isolated, backed into a corner, and under a time constraint, may make an otherwise rash decision.” — Sascha Glaeser, Washington Times

A greater NATO presence on Russia’s border increases the odds of catastrophic conflict

“Finland—if it allows NATO bases, troops, and weaponry within its borders—could permanently heighten the hair-trigger environment that now exists between the Kremlin and Washington.” — Michael Hirsh, Foreign Policy

NATO’s expansion after the Cold War inspired Putin’s invasion of Ukraine

“If there had been no decision to move NATO eastward to include Ukraine, Crimea and the Donbass would be part of Ukraine today, and there would be no war in Ukraine.” — John Mearsheimer, political scientist, to New Yorker

NATO makes the world less safe

“To the degree that this rudderless security pact has made war easier, more salable, and more attractive for Western leaders than diplomacy, the alliance has been a liability to peace and stability.” — Chase Madar, The Nation

Greater militarism will never create a path to peace

“Europe goes ahead and arms itself to the teeth to protect itself. … So therefore, [Russia says] we have to arm ourselves to the teeth to defend ourselves from the onslaught of this extraordinarily powerful force against NATO. I mean, if anybody’s observing this from outer space, they’d be cracking up in laughter.” — Noam Chomsky, linguist and political commentator, to Intercept

The U.S. shouldn’t sign up to protect even more weak countries

“We have to understand that nothing is done in a vacuum, and for Finland and Sweden to be added to NATO adds a burden to the entire alliance. … And it adds yet another level of potential risk for the United States.” — Daniel Davis, foreign policy expert, to The Hill

"This Week in Apps: Google bans call-recording apps, Snap’s Q1 and BeReal hype – TechCrunch","Welcome back to This Week in Apps, the weekly TechCrunch series that recaps the latest in mobile OS news, mobile applications and the overall app economy.

The app industry continues to grow, with a record number of downloads and consumer spending across both the iOS and Google Play stores combined in 2021, according to the latest year-end reports. Global spending across iOS, Google Play and third-party Android app stores in China grew 19% in 2021 to reach $170 billion. Downloads of apps also grew by 5%, reaching 230 billion in 2021, and mobile ad spend grew 23% year over year to reach $295 billion.

Today’s consumers now spend more time in apps than ever before — even topping the time they spend watching TV, in some cases. The average American watches 3.1 hours of TV per day, for example, but in 2021, they spent 4.1 hours on their mobile device. And they’re not even the world’s heaviest mobile users. In markets like Brazil, Indonesia and South Korea, users surpassed five hours per day in mobile apps in 2021.

Apps aren’t just a way to pass idle hours, either. They can grow to become huge businesses. In 2021, 233 apps and games generated over $100 million in consumer spend, and 13 topped $1 billion in revenue. This was up 20% from 2020, when 193 apps and games topped $100 million in annual consumer spend, and just eight apps topped $1 billion.

This Week in Apps offers a way to keep up with this fast-moving industry in one place, with the latest from the world of apps, including news, updates, startup fundings, mergers and acquisitions, and suggestions about new apps to try, too.

Top Stories

Google bans call-recording apps

Google updated its Play Store policies to ban third-party call-recording apps from the Play Store, effective as of May 11. Developers had been using the Accessibility API to enable remote call audio recording as a workaround to make these apps work after Google blocked call recording on Android 6 and via the microphone on Android 10. The change was announced alongside other updates on April 6, but a Reddit post drove new awareness of the crackdown. Google also livestreamed a policy update this week where it explained this was not actually a “new” policy, necessarily, but rather a clarification to an existing one. (The video is labeled April 2020 but this appears to be a mislabel, because YouTube shows it was streamed April 2022 — and commenters are also noting the typo.) While that may be true, the company had not taken action on apps using the Accessibility API in this way.

In the webinar, Moun Choi, who works on the Trust & Safety Play Regional Ops team for Google Play, explained the focus of the policy was directed toward third-party apps where the call recording was taking place without the other user’s awareness. The default dialer on the phone would not be impacted by this, as it doesn’t need the accessible capability to get access to the incoming audio stream, he said. The company didn’t clarify if existing apps would be removed from the Play Store when the policy goes into effect, however.

BeReal: Hype or hit?

An app called BeReal, founded by former GoPro employee Alexis Barreyat along with Kévin Perreau, launched in December 2019 with the idea to ask users to post an unedited photo once per day after receiving a notification. The user then has up to 2 minutes to share what they’re up to and see the photos their friends also posted. The app has recently gained a lot of attention amid rapid growth and a daily active user base that’s now reached nearly 3 million, according to data from Apptopia. But when an app grows this quickly, there are usually some paid user acquisition efforts involved. This week, we took a look into how BeReal may be capitalizing on its newer features and college ambassador program to drive installs and its five-star reviews. The verdict: It’s too soon to know if BeReal can self-sustain when the funds run out.

Musk secures his Twitter bid

Elon Musk this week secured $46.5 billion to acquire Twitter, per an SEC filing. The Telsa and SpaceX chief’s offer for the social network includes $25.5 billion in debt financing from Morgan Stanley and other firms, including Bank of America, Barclays, MUFG, Societe Generale, Mizuho Bank and BNP Paribas. Musk said he’s committed to about $21 billion in equity financing. Previously, Musk hadn’t been specific about how he would pay for the investment, so these financial commitments make the deal more serious. The tech CEO hasn’t yet said if he will make a tender offer, however. Twitter had already adopted a poison-pill defense of its equity as a result of Musk’s unsolicited bid.

The top eight live shopping apps grew their installs 123% year-over-year in the first quarter, but their collective user base is still small considering the amount of VC investment they’ve seen. Combined, the apps have less than two million monthly active app users. The firm looked at apps like Whatnot, NTWRK, Popshop Live, ShopShops, likeQ, ShopThing, LIT Live and Drip Shop Live in its analysis.

Snap’s Q1 2022 saw healthy user growth amid an earnings miss. Snap missed Wall Street expectations for profit and sales in the first quarter, pulling in a loss of 2 cents versus the expected 1 cent earnings, and revenue of $1.06 billion versus the $1.07 billion expected. But the app’s bright spot was user growth, 332 million DAUs (up 18% YoY) versus 330 million expected. This follows five previous quarters of user growth north of 20%. But Snap is still adapting to the fallout from Apple’s Privacy Changes. Though it’s implemented new measurement solutions that better respect user privacy, Snap told investors the changes take time. “They put a serious onus on advertisers to adapt and reset their advertising campaigns across not just Snap, but all platforms. We empathize with them,” says Snap Chief Business Officer Jeremi Gorman.

Deal terms feel like dart boards these days – TechCrunch,"Welcome to Startups Weekly, a fresh human-first take on this week’s startup news and trends. To get this in your inbox, subscribe here.

When Andreessen Horowitz unveiled its new early-stage startup accelerator, which has been in the works for over a year, my eyes searched for two things: check size and ownership target. I care about value-add services and micro-focuses, such as a goal to back diverse founders or a Web 2.5 track, but I first care about how new programs, such as A16z START, are advertising their money.

The reason? The standard deal of an accelerator says a lot about which founders they plan to attract. Some programs may tout their check size, others may highlight the non-dilutive nature of their cash and a select few are claiming that equity in exchange for access is an outdated way to work.

In this case, a16z is going to decide deal terms on a case by case basis for founders who get to the final round of the interview process. The max that a founder can get is $1 million in initial funding. The vagueness, and general focus, seemingly piggybacks off of Sequoia’s recently announced program, which will invest a check size of $1 million into founders for an undisclosed equity stake. While I’m pro more money going into early-stage founders, I’m also pro tell me how much equity I’ll be giving up before I dedicate time to the interview process. So, I thought the vagueness was kind of weird. Not malicious, necessarily, but weird!

it is weird that neither a16z or sequoia have publicly disclosed what ownership they're targeting in their new accelerator efforts, right? — natasha (@nmasc_) April 19, 2022

Of course, tech Twitter had some thoughts! One of my followers said that wiggle room is helpful, especially for a firm like A16z for which it’s their first formal foray into backing startups as early as possible. I don’t disagree with that, similar to traditional demo days, which assume that every startup in a batch is ready to raise money on the same day; a standard deal assumes that every startup’s monetary needs are created equally, regardless of solution, background or sector.

Another said the deals are quiet so other accelerators can’t copy their terms. A lot of folks thought they’re going after Y Combinator, because why leave all the upside to one Index-fund-lookin’ institution. One day startups may be asking themselves: Y9r or a16z?

For more thoughts, read my TechCrunch+ piece: Why does A16z need its own Y Combinator? You can also listen to the latest Equity podcast, which got into this topic and much, much more.

In this newsletter, we’ll talk about Opendoor alumni, a post-layoff pivot and JOKR’s interview. As always, you can support me by forwarding this newsletter to a friend, following me on Twitter or subscribing to my personal blog.

When one door opens

Our deal of the week is Kindred! Mary Ann Azevedo reported this week that Opendoor alums Justine Palefsky and Tasneem Amina founded Kindred, a startup that wants to make traveling more accessible through home swapping. So far, the duo has raised $7.75 million to help make the option available to more people.

Here’s why it’s important: The Opendoor alumni network is certainly making moves, with Kindred being the latest entrepreneurial haunt to come out of residential real estate company. This upstart particularly stands out because of its focus on accessibility, which the proptech sector could always use more of.

Read this excerpt from CEO Justine Palefsky, in which she describes the “aha moment” of the startup:

“We started Kindred after we struggled with the problem ourselves. We were both working remotely and we wanted to take advantage of that flexibility to travel more and work from elsewhere. But none of the existing solutions or ways to do that really made sense for us and for our lives,” Palefsky said. “We felt like we had three options. One, we could get an Airbnb somewhere, which became too expensive for trips longer than just a few nights. Or you could give up your home and become a nomad. Or you could run your home like a hotel and put it on Airbnb to finance your travel. None of those options felt right for us because they are inconvenient and a little scary.”

Flockjay lands on something new

Months after cutting half its staff, edtech startup Flockjay has landed on a new vision for how to disrupt tech sales: start from the inside, out. CEO Shaan Hathiramani opened up about the pivot, the cuts and what he learned when he tried to build a bootcamp and eventually landed on a SaaS tool.

Here’s why it’s important: The company most recently raised venture funding in an $11 million Series A in January 2021, per Crunchbase data. Hathiramani said the growth pace made it feel like Flockjay was “running about six or seven businesses at once.” He went on to say that the team was running an admissions and selection business, a training business, a coaching and placement business and an alumni community, something that caused burnout among the less than 100-person team.

More problematic, perhaps, was the fact that Flockjay was not “growing at the speed that you want it too.” So, he turned to his board and decided to scale back programming until they found a more sustainable business — announced today.

JOKR’s fresh take on grocery delivery

Our own Christine Hall sat down with Ralf Wenzel, JOKR’s founder and CEO, to talk about the grocery delivery wars and his company’s differentiated model. Despite growing pains, the company went on to raise $260 million in December to become a billion-dollar company. So, how did it convince people that something as unprofitable and hard to scale as grocery delivery is worth more investment money?

Here’s why it’s important: In the interview, Wenzel talks about building a “proposition out more toward fresh” products like fruits, vegetables and meat cuts. The CEO says by not just focusing on convenience store goods, the company hit “fully gross profit positive on a group level for our local business across all of our countries after 12 months of operations.”

To me, this signals that customer habits have matured so much that they want more than convenience from delivery services. Instead of a last-minute crutch, folks want help with everyday needs — which means startups can differentiate if they think of authentic services ahead of everyone else.

Now I’m hungry:

"‘The Northman’ Filmmaker Robert Eggers on Nailing Nude Battle Scene, Managing Epic Production","Standing front and center beneath the big screen inside Hollywood’s TCL Chinese Theatre, Robert Eggers had an important message to share about The Northman. “I want to say that this is not a film by Robert Eggers,” said the filmmaker on Monday night ahead of the premiere as he was joined by actors Alexander Skarsgard, Nicole Kidman, Anya Taylor-Joy, Willem Dafoe, Gustav Lindh and Oscar Novak. “It’s a film made by an enormous amount of collaborators.”

Eggers went on to single out many of them, starting with Focus Features and New Regency for backing his vision for a Viking epic that tells the story of a young prince as he seeks to avenge his father’s murder. “Supporting a filmmaker and making a large-scale film that’s not a superhero movie is a very rare thing, and I truly feel incredibly grateful and privileged to have made this film,” he noted, before adding that it was “a beast to make,” echoing earlier comments made to The Hollywood Reporter on the red carpet.

Asked to single out his most stressful day on set, Eggers said the entire shoot “was only hard,” due to all the elements of an authentic and large-scale production. “If it’s not a Viking raid of a village with hundreds of extras of stuntmen, horses, cows, chickens, geese, children, then it was a storm at sea at night on a Viking ship, or a naked sword fight on a volcano,” he noted, with the latter referencing the (spoiler alert!) epic climax that features a nude battle between Skarsgard’s Amleth and Claes Bang’s Fjölnir. Below, Eggers opens up about why they had to add CG genitals to the scene, his meticulous research process and why you won’t find him sneaking in the back of any screenings on opening weekend.

What do you make of this scene — Hollywood Boulevard lined with fans, Viking music playing in the background?

Childhood me is very proud, so that’s cool.

With The Northman, you made the leap to $70 million-plus filmmaking. What was the best part of having more money to play with? And the most challenging part of a bigger budget?

Again, talking about childhood me, I got to build a Viking village in a Viking city with longships and merchant ships. It’s completely crazy. But the challenge is, you get a lot more responsibility on your shoulders, and that can be intimidating at times, but me and my collaborators, we were up for the challenge.

We could spend weeks talking about your meticulous research process. In the simplest terms, what does it look like? Do you lock yourself away? How do you tune out while you focus?

I like to read a lot of books and watch things. I listen to podcasts as much as I can. But we had the privilege of literally working with the world’s greatest Viking historians and archeologists in the field of Viking studies on this movie, all the way from the writing through postproduction. It’s a unique film in that way.

This movie reunites you with Anya Taylor-Joy. How has she changed as a performer since The Witch?

She was great when she was 18, she’s great now. Both of us have gotten better at our craft. I think where she’s changed the most is just that her professionalism on set is an inspiration for everyone who works with her. I know that’s boring, but it is cool, especially when she’s wearing a potato sack barefoot in the mud with horizontal rain, and she’s got a good attitude. That’s helpful for everybody.

Professionalism is never boring, and some of your collaborators have given you similar compliments tonight. I imagine that wasn’t always easy while managing this production. What’s the most stressful day?

If it’s not a Viking raid of a village with hundreds of extras of stuntmen, horses, cows, chickens, geese, children, then it was a storm at sea at night on a Viking ship, or a naked sword fight on a volcano. I mean, there was nothing easy about making this movie. It was only hard.

Since you brought it up, let’s talk about the naked sword fight. Did you have to do some digital erasure there?

We actually had to add things digitally because they were wearing thongs [instead of being naked] because no one wanted to get their bits chopped off. So, we actually had to add some CG genitals for certain shots so that they didn’t look too Ken doll-ish. You’ve got to make it look real, so I’m sure we did some full-body scans of Alex. They’re out there.

Robert Eggers explained why he had to add CGI genitals to Alexander Skarsgård's naked Viking fight in #TheNorthman pic.twitter.com/eLRFzIJZiP — The Hollywood Reporter (@THR) April 21, 2022

I read that you’ve said that nobody is Method on your sets. Is that a rule or just coincidence?

If someone wants to be Method, they’re more than welcome to be Method. But my main direction is don’t blink, don’t move your face, and say your lines. When you have an archetypal story with archetypal characters — Alexander Skarsgard looks like a Viking, is playing a Viking, on a mountain and dressed as a Viking — just say your lines. I know there’s more to it than that, but in a way, with this cast, it’s almost that simple.

Where will you be this weekend when it opens here? Will you sneak into any screenings?

I saw this movie 19 times in the last two weeks of postproduction. I’m all set, thanks. I’ll watch it tonight, but then I’m done.

Focus Features kept the party going with a post-premiere event held at L.A.’s new hotspot Mother Wolf. Earlier on the carpet, Taylor-Joy praised Eggers for being “my original film teacher,” crediting him for how she’s grown in her career. “What I really realized is how much of the way that I comport myself on set, how much of that comes from him,” she explained. “He’s a great person to learn from.” Alberto E.

Harry Styles Welcomes Lizzo for Pair of Hits at Coachella Weekend 2,"Harry Styles and Lizzo perform for the SiriusXM and Pandora Opening Drive Super Concert Series at the Fillmore Miami Beach during Super Bowl Week on Jan. 30, 2020.

Harry Styles brought out special guest Lizzo during his headlining set at weekend two of the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on Friday night.

Toward the end of his high-energy main stage performance, the 28-year-old British pop star surprised festivalgoers by inviting the “Truth Hurts” singer onstage for a dazzling cover of Gloria Gaynor’s 1978 disco anthem “I Will Survive” and a lively rendition of One Direction‘s popular “What Makes You Beautiful.”

During their festive Coachella team-up, the two friends — who have formed a sweet bond in recent years — strutted up and down the stage donning brightly colored faux fur coats while belting out the pair of hits. “I Will Survive” spent three weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 in 1978-79, and “What Makes You Beautiful” enjoyed four weeks atop the chart in 2012.

“Proud of you @harrystyles. Thank u for having me,” Lizzo captioned an overjoyed selfie of herself alongside Styles on Instagram.

The singer-rapper-songwriter-flautist, 33, who hosted Saturday Night Live last weekend, teased her Coachella appearance earlier Friday by sharing a TikTok video of herself traveling to the California desert. “I’m bored otw to Coachella,” she captioned the clip.

Styles made his Coachella debut during the opening weekend of the festival on April 15. During his performance, the Grammy winner welcomed Shania Twain for duets of her hits “Man!

"From Father’s Day to Birthdays, These Are the Best Gifts for New Dads","If you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, SPY.com may receive an affiliate commission.

Father’s Day is almost here and for new dads, their first Father’s Day is one of the most memorable. Becoming a dad is an exciting time. It’s also overwhelming, exhausting, and TBH a little bit terrifying. Thankfully, there are plenty of great parenting books to help with some of the scary parts, plus helpful guides on baby products from SPY (check out our guides on baby monitors, baby gadgets and items new parents can’t live without). But what about products specifically for dad? We’ve got you covered there as well with a list of the best gifts for new dads.

First Father’s Day gifts can be a way to pamper a new pop, help him get his grooming on, enjoy a mocktail and catch some sleep whenever possible (seriously, nap when the baby naps). Gifts for new dads can also be products that enable dads to help their partner, whether that means sanitizing bottles or pump parts, taking the little one for a stroll or prepping a delicious dinner. Then there are the first Father’s Day gifts that are all about cuteness — when in doubt, get it personalized.

From socks to matching outfits, silky sheets to baby carriers, these are the best gifts for new dads.

1. Our First Father’s Day Together Shirt and Onesie

FOR THE MATCHING DAD

Most grown men try to avoid wearing the same outfit as someone else unless that person is tiny and cute. Help a dad celebrate his first Father’s Day with a matching t-shirt and onesie combo that will elicit all the ‘awwwws.’

2. Isshindo Honpo Captain America Sheet Mask

FOR THE DAD WHO NEEDS SOME PAMPERING

If becoming a new dad is wearing on your skin, it’s time for some TLC. Even dads who don’t typically focus on grooming or pampering will appreciate the new Captain America face masks from Isshindo. SPY received a sample and we loved how moisturizing the Vitamin C and collagen-packed masks felt. It also felt cool to look like Captain America. Dads are the true superheroes.

3. Wide Mouth HydroFlask

FOR THE THIRSTY DAD

New dads have likely spent months making decisions about names, nursery colors, which car seat/stroller/crib/baby monitor/etc. to buy. Becoming a new dad requires a lot of decisions. Give new dads a high-quality water bottle from Hydro Flask and let them customize the bottle and make really fun, super easy decisions. Available in several sizes (we like the Wide Mouth option that makes it easy to add ice), HydroFlasks are vacuum-sealed to keep cold drinks cold for 24 hours, hot drinks hot for 12 hours, and are dishwasher friendly. SPY received a sample of HydroFlask’s personalized bottle and choosing the size, colors, and accessories, and being able to personalize the bottle with a name was a fun and easy decision.

4. Ergobaby Omni Breeze Baby Carrier

FOR THE DAD ON THE GO

Not sure which new dads can benefit from a baby carrier? That’s easy. The answer is — all new dads. This is without a doubt one of the best gifts for new dads. Whether your new dad likes to hike trails or hike through the mall, take airplane trips or short drives to the park, a baby carrier is one of the most useful items for new parents. It allows them to be hands-free while still keeping their little ones close. It helps new parents bond with their babies and carriers like the Ergobaby Breeze evenly distribute weight to help lessen back pain and can be used from birth all the way up to 45 pounds.

5. My Sheets Rock

FOR HOT DADS

All dads are hot (yeah dads!), but for those who are literally hot, especially when sleeping, they need sheets to keep them cool. Sleep is always important and even more so for new dads, who are probably getting much less shut-eye than they are used to. SPY received a sample of the high-grade bamboo rayon cooling sheets from My Sheets Rock and we agree — these sheets rock. They are uber soft, moisture-wicking, odor eliminating, and cool to the touch. Plus, their packaging is super fun (there are sound effects!) making them another easy gift to order and present to a new dad.

6. Cotton Napper – Bearaby

FOR THE COZY DAD

First-time dads are likely very excited about all the snuggles they are about to have with their little one. Help them get cozy while reading a book with this chunky weighted throw from Bearaby. Bearaby makes one of the best weighted blankets on the market right now, which is available in a handful of weights and fabrics. Especially if the new dad in your life is losing sleep from baby (which is likely) he will certainly appreciate this cozy gift.

7. Ted Lasso Father’s Day Card

FOR THE ENCOURAGING DAD

A big part of becoming a dad is being a coach and cheerleader all in one and no one knows that better than Ted Lasso. Shutterfly has a line of officially licensed Ted Lasso gear that is perfect for dads who believe in believe. Cards, towels, blankets, drinkware, mousepads, and more, Ted Lasso merch can be personalized with pictures and messages of encouragement. Football/fatherhood is life!

8. Henson AL13 Razor

FOR DADS WHO LIKE A CLOSE SHAVE

Stubble may look cool, but when it’s time to get cheek to cheek with newborns, a clean-shaven dad will have a better snuggle time. Babies should not have to deal with beard rash. We like the Henson AL13 Razor, which is designed to be the last razor dads will ever have to buy (save your money for the college fund!). Made from aerospace-grade aluminum, the Henson promises a precise and close shave that leaves users with baby soft skin, which is exactly what new dads need.

9. My Face Socks

FOR THE DAD WHO HAS EVERYTHING

What do you get the new dad who has everything? A pair of custom socks with his newborn’s cute mug. Dads can never have too many socks and they’re a one-size-fits-all piece of clothing.

10. Evenflo Silicone Reusable Sanitizer Microwave Steam Bags

FOR THE HELPFUL DAD

For new dads who are supporting a partner that is pumping or for families that are formula feeding, cleaning bottles, pacifiers and pump parts is a great way for dads to feel involved and lessen the workload for their partner. One of the easiest ways is with the Evenflo Silicone Reusable Sanitizer Microwave Steam Bags. The BPA, non-toxic, FDA food-grade reusable silicone bags, which double as snack containers, can sanitize small items quickly and efficiently.

11. Luxury Living Furniture Wood FabSlab Cutting Board

FOR THE DAD WHO LOVES TO COOK

New dads who love to cook, or at least are willing to learn to cook, will appreciate this stunning cutting board by the Australian brand FabSlab. Touted as the world’s most hygienic cutting boards, new dads will be able to keep germs and bacteria at bay thanks to this beautiful and durable cutting board. Naturally and permanently antibacterial, tests have shown that common food viruses like E. coli, salmonella, staph, and listeria can’t survive for an extended time on a FabSlab board. SPY received a sample of the beautiful cutting board and we appreciated that it’s not only functional but doubles as a charcuterie display board.

12. Skip Hop Pronto Baby Changing Station & Diaper Clutch

FOR MINIMALIST DADS

For dads who don’t want to carry a diaper bag or would prefer to carry their own backpack and need a few added essentials, we like the newly released Skip Hop Pronto Baby Changing Station & Diaper Clutch. Featuring a sturdy exterior eco-friendly fabric that is made from 100% recycled PET bottles, the Pronto is a unisex-style changing pad and diaper clutch in one. The Pronto unfolds to reveal an easy to clean, padded changing pad. A plastic wipe holder is included, and the front of the clutch has a zippered section that can store keys, a wallet, and a phone. SPY received a sample of the sleek Pronto and we especially liked that the roomy mesh pockets were big enough for diapers, creams, and even a backup outfit and bib. The clutch includes a clip for attaching to a stroller, backpack, or suitcase.

13. Wallet Slayer Vol. 1 from Smartish

FOR THE TECH DAD

Smartish has a huge selection of durable and functional smartphone cases that can be customized. The Wallet Slayer includes room for three cards and cash and can be personalized with text or images, making it one of the best gifts for new dads as they can upload a pic of their new family addition for regular viewing.

14. Outlaw Soaps Blazing Saddles Gift Set

FOR THE DAD WHO LIKES TO SMELL GOOD

New dads don’t always get much time to shower, so help them make the most of their scrubbing time with a gift set from Outlaw Soaps. SPY received a sample of the Blazing Saddles soap and loved the Western-inspired packaging and the natural ingredients, which are perfect for dads who don’t want any harsh chemicals rubbing off on baby. The soap smells like leather, sandalwood, and sagebrush and not at all like spit-up.

15. Clean Co Premium Boston Shaker Set

FOR THE ALCOHOL-FREE DAD

For dads who don’t drink, Clean Co. is a new non-alcoholic drink company that has created stylish and delicious alcohol alternatives. The company’s rum, tequila, vodka and gin alternatives are all packaged in a beautiful glass bottle that will look impressive on any bar cart and deliver a smooth taste that is close to the real thing. SPY received a sample and we appreciated the authentic taste and chic packaging. Gift sets, like the Boston Shaker Set, make for an especially impressive present.

16. Seattle Chocolate Spring Bar Trio

FOR THE DAD WITH THE SWEET TOOTH

Dads with a sweet tooth will love the new Spring Bar Trio from Seattle Chocolate. Featuring beautiful packaging by artist Llewellyn Mejia, the limited edition set includes Chocolate Wafer Cone Truffle Bar, Carrot Cake Truffle Bar, and Honey, Almond, and Coconut Truffle Bar. SPY received a sample of the delicious set and we can confirm that dad likely won’t be sharing any of his bars.

Wildfires explode in drought-hit New Mexico,"Smoke drifts from a fire in the neighbourhood of The Farm, in Colorado Springs, Colorado, U.S., April 22, 2022 in this image obtained from social media via REUTERS

TAOS, N.M., April 23 (Reuters) - Wind-driven wildfires exploded in size in northern New Mexico, destroying multiple homes and forcing hundreds to flee mountain villages as blazes raged early in the year in the parched U.S. Southwest.

Two wildfires merged northwest of Las Vegas, New Mexico and raced through 15 miles of forest driven by winds of over 75 mph (121 kph), local authorities and fire officials said on Saturday.

To the northeast, fierce winds sent another blaze towards the Philmont Scout Ranch and the village of Cimarron.

The wildfires were the most severe of nearly two dozen in the U.S. Southwest and raised concerns the region was in for a brutal fire year as a decades-long drought combined with abundant dry vegetation.

""Fire season isn't even here yet, you know this is April,"" said Michael Johnson, a spokesman for the Santa Fe National Forest and a 20-year veteran wildland firefighter. ""This is probably one of the biggest fire events I've been associated with.""

The so-called Calf Canyon and Hermits Peak fires combined to burn 42,341 acres, an area larger than Florida's Disney World. The blaze was set to turn east into dry grassland, giving crews a chance to bulldoze fire breaks to protect Mora and other villages to the north, said incident commander Jayson Coil.

Over 500 homes were evacuated but some people chose to stay behind, according to local authorities.

""We have heard there was pretty extensive damage,"" said Joy Ansley, a spokeswoman for San Miguel County in Las Vegas. ""It sounds like Pendaries was maybe hit pretty hard.""

Pendaries is a rural community with dozens of homes as well as a resort area and golf club near the village of Rociada.

Climate change has lowered winter snowpacks and allowed larger and more extreme fires to start earlier in the year, according to scientists. read more

Around 35 miles east of Taos, New Mexico, the Cooks Peak fire threatened the Philmont Scout Ranch and village of Cimarron. Firefighters in Arizona continued to contain the Tunnel fire near Flagstaff which has burned dozens of homes.

KYIV, April 23 (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will travel to Kyiv on Sunday and hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian leader said on Saturday.

He told a news conference in Kyiv that he would discuss the kinds of weapons that Ukraine needs to battle Russia's invasion.

JERUSALEM, April 23 (Reuters) - With processions, chants and ululations, thousands of Christian Palestinians and pilgrims celebrated the Holy Fire ceremony at Jerusalem's Church of the Holy Sepulchre on Saturday, the first to be held since Israel imposed new restrictions on attendance.

Citing public safety, Israeli authorities sought to limit participation to 1,700 worshippers, a move criticised by church leaders as an infringement of the right to freedom of worship. It was subsequently increased to 4,000.

The mysterious, millennium-old ceremony, which celebrates Jesus's resurrection, has drawn over ten thousand worshippers in previous years.

After hours of anticipation from the crowd, Jerusalem's Greek Orthodox patriarch entered the tomb where Christians believe Jesus was buried and emerged carrying a lighted candle - without the aid of matches.

Within seconds, the light spread across the darkened church that is revered by Christians as the site of Jesus's crucifixion, burial and resurrection. The bells competed with cheers from the crowd as a smoky haze filled the chapels.

Michael Toumayan, a 36-year-old Armenian Christian, was among the first to receive the light.

""It’s an honour,"" he said. ""My father has been doing this since he was a kid and he’s passing down this tradition to me.""

After two years of COVID-19 travel restrictions, Israel has recently started allowing foreign tourists back into the country and Christians had arrived from around the world.

It took ""a lot of faith and determination"" to make it, said Alina Lord, 48, who flew in from Romania. She woke up at 5 a.m. to attend and managed to secure a position right across the tomb's opening.

For Sophia Gorgis, 65, who fled the Syrian war to Sweden, it had been a lifelong dream to celebrate the Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem.

""I have no words,” she said, choking up. ""As soon as we got our (Swedish) passports, we signed up for this trip.""

The Holy Sepulchre lies at the heart of the Old City's Christian Quarter in East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move that has not won international recognition.

The Greek and Armenian Orthodox churches share custody of the Holy Sepulchre with the Roman Catholics, who celebrated Easter last week.

In the past, the light set fire to people's clothes, even their hair, said Tareq Abu Gharbiyyeh, East Jerusalem's fire chief who has been fire-proofing the ceremony for the last 30 years.

""Thankfully, it was nothing serious,"" he said.

This year, too, the ceremony ended safely.
